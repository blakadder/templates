How to [open the plug](https://blakadder.com/disassembling-CN39/). The ESP8266EX is on a Aubess Wi-Fi module labeled M32-V1.0 has the same pinout as the TYWE2S, with a minor layout change with the GPIO pins.(they clearly labelled though). [Module images](https://imgur.com/a/jh7oJlh).

Short GPIO0 (labelled 00 M32-V1.0 PCB) on when powering to enable flash mode.

RX and TX are soldered together (bridged) on the board, so best practice is to de-solder the module when flashing. This cannot be flashed OTA with Tuya-convert.
