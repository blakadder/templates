To expose the motion and daylight sensors to Home Assistant, these commands are used:
```
SwitchMode1 2;
SwitchMode2 1;
SetOption114 1
```
Sensors are decoupled by default. `SwitchMode1 2` sets the motion sensor to inverted-follow,
which results in the switch showing `on` when motion is detected. `SwitchMode2 1` sets the
ambient light sensor to follow, so `on` represents light detected. And `SetOption114 1` sends
the switch status via MQTT. The button will still operate the relay.
