After flash with Tuya-Convert and update to current release tasmota.bin :

- Go to WebUI and then Console
- Enter command `TuyaMCU 21,2`
- Set Dimmer Range with `DimmerRange 150,1000`

Now Dimmer Command should work from 0-100.

If no dimming occurs try changing the dimming mode:

- Dimming Mode 1: `SerialSend5 55AA00060005040400010013`
- Dimming Mode 2: `SerialSend5 55AA00060005040400010114`
- Dimming Mode 3: `SerialSend5 55AA00060005040400010215`
