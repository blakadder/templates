**WARNING**: Series II variants of these devices are now appearing on the shelves which include
the WB3L chip which is NOT ESP2866-based and therefore compatible with Tasmota.

You can identity these by looking at the printed label on the bulb itself, where it will clearly be
labelled as *Series II*. The original variant which is ESP2866 based, will not identify as Series I.

They will need to be flashed via serial as they will very likely have a newer firmware preventing a
tuya-convert flash.
