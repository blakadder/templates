As of 20 September 2020 this device cannot be flashed with tuya-convert.  

Manual flashing is possible using the following steps.
NOTE: DO NOT PLUG INTO MAINS until 100% done.
1) Carefully break glass and remove
2) Remove white deflector around LED panel
3) Unplug connector to LED panel
4) Carefully dig out esp module by first using a knife around entire silicon blob, it will pull out from white retaining section. 
Then carefully using a screw driver, pick away at the black silicon around the modul. It is an upright module on the right side. 
Dig it out only enough to expose the pads on the bottom and the IO0 pad on the back side of board. The board itself is pretty well marked,
but if you need a reference, review https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/wifilc4module?id=K9605t0d19jiy
5) Solder wires for flashing to 3.3V, TX, RX, GND and IO0.
6) Flash by pulling IO0 to ground. Default Generic ESP8266 module settings work to flash. DO NOT PLUG INTO MAINS until 100% done.
7) Confirm response via serial or connect via wifi
8) Remove wires
9) Replace glass(plexi glass works)
