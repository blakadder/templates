To enable standard (factory) functionality of the Status LED (displaying Wi-Fi Connection Status) add this Rule: 
`Rule1 on system#boot do Backlog LedPower 1; LedState 0; LedPower 1; LedState 8; endon'

This rule enables the status LED when its connected to Wi-Fi, without this rule the default behaviour will result in the Status LED switching on & off every time the Relay is activated. 

October 2021 - Updated product uses the ESP WB3S chip which is not compatible with Tasmota/ESPHome/etc. Packaging has a model number of 6912HA - Series 2
