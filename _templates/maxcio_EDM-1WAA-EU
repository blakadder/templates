Once the template is applied, run the following commands to configure communication with the MCU:
```console
Backlog SetOption97 1; TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 21,2; DimmerRange 10,1000
```

The ESP talks to a secondary MCU at a different baud rate so that is why SetOption97 is required.


The Minimum dimmer range for the physical knob can be set with `TuyaSend2 3,10`
