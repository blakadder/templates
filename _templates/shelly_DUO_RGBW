### This template enables :

  - Separate control of RGB and White channels with brightness control ([SetOption37](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Lights/#rgb-and-white-split) to split them and [virtual CT mode](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Lights/#virtual-ct))
  - 2 buttons COLOR and WHITE to toggle the power of eatch channel (can be renamed by modifying the template)
  - Fading with speed 2 (can be adjusted in the console up to 40) ([Fade at boot and power on](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#setoption91))
  - A rule which turns off one channel when the user turns on the other one, so RGB and White are not active **at the same time**. This is personnal preference so there is a minimalist template lower down.
  - Temperature monitoring (±5°C, not accurate but gives a rough idea). Safety cut off(?) lowered at 85°C instead of the default (SetOption42).

Minimal template (without fading and rule):
```
{"NAME":"Shelly Duo RGBW","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,0,419,0,0,417,416,418,0,0,4736],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18,"CMND":"AdcParam 2, 32000, 1000, 3950|SetOption37 128|SetOption106 1|SetOption107 0|WebButton1 COLOR|WebButton2 WHITE|SetOption42 85"}
```

Thank's to @jwiesel for the base template. Here is some of his researches :

- Correct OTA mgos [firmware](https://github.com/arendst/mgos-to-tasmota)
- Pogo clip for [serial flashing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5710034)
- White blend mode: `SetOption105 1`
- Virtual CT mode: `SetOption106 1` and `SetOption107 0`

### Troubleshooting
After replacing the Shelly Firmware by Tasmota and connecting the buld to your wifi, the Tasmota Web-UI might not come up, although the device IP is connected.
To fix the issue, recover the bulb via [PowerCycle](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Device-Recovery/#fast-power-cycle-device-recovery), connect to the "tasmota-..." wifi again and open the Tasmota Web-UI.
Instead of selecting your network, open the Console via URL http://tasmota-ip/cs and enter ```reset 1```. Now you can connect the bulb to your network and the Web-UI will come up as expected.
