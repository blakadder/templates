### Troubleshooting
After replacing the Shelly Firmware by Tasmota and connecting the buld to your wifi, the Tasmota Web-UI might not come up, although the device IP is connected.
To fix the issue, recover the bulb via [PowerCycle](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Device-Recovery/#fast-power-cycle-device-recovery), connect to the "tasmota-..." wifi again and open the Tasmota Web-UI.
Instead of selecting your network, open the Console via URL http://tasmota-ip/cs and enter ```reset 1```. Now you can connect the bulb to your network and the Web-UI will come up as expected.
