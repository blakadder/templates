This template enables :
  - Separate control of RGB and White channels with brightness control ([SetOption37](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Lights/#rgb-and-white-split) to split them and [virtual CT mode](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Lights/#virtual-ct))
  - 2 buttons COLOR and WHITE to toggle the power of eatch channel (can be renamed by modifying the template)
  - Fading with speed 2 (can be adjusted in the console up to 40)
  - A rule which turns off one channel when the user turns on the other one, so RGB and White are not active *at the same time*. This is personnal preference so there is a minimalist template lower down.
  - Temperature monitoring (±5°C, not accurate but gives a rough idea). Safety cut off(?) lowered at 85°C instead of the default (SetOption42).



Correct OTA mgos [firmware](https://github.com/arendst/mgos-to-tasmota)

Pogo clip for [serial flashing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5710034)

White blend mode: `SetOption105 1`

Virtual CT mode: `SetOption106 1` and `SetOption107 0`"

### Troubleshooting
After replacing the Shelly Firmware by Tasmota and connecting the buld to your wifi, the Tasmota Web-UI might not come up, although the device IP is connected.
To fix the issue, recover the bulb via [PowerCycle](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Device-Recovery/#fast-power-cycle-device-recovery), connect to the "tasmota-..." wifi again and open the Tasmota Web-UI.
Instead of selecting your network, open the Console via URL http://tasmota-ip/cs and enter ```reset 1```. Now you can connect the bulb to your network and the Web-UI will come up as expected.
