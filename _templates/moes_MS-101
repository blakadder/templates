step1: solder the wires according to image 1

step2: connect usb-to-ttl adapter to pc, make sure GPIO0 is bridged with GND.

Step 3: Open Tasmotizer select the com corresponding to the adapter, and select release tasmota.bin image (first in the list) then hit the Tasmotize! and wait for the flashing to finish.

Step 4: Once the process is finished, disconnect the adapter and reconnect by removing the jumper between GPIO0 and GND, now you can configure the already tasmoted device."
