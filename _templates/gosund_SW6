### Synopsis
This assumes standard 3-way lighting with a child 'dumb' toggle switch connected to the travelers. 

### Components
Component | Description. 
--------- | -----------  
Relay1 | A dummy component that stores the power state of the switch.  
Relay2 | The actual hardware switch. This controls the state of the circuit (on|off) but, is not a direct indiction of the state of the circuit. The relay could be on while the ciruit is open.  
Relay3 | A dummy component used to process external commands. This is necessary to allow explicit control of the state of the circuit. It should always be in the same state as Relay 1. 
Switch1 | The status of the circuit. Switch1's state will change when the circuit changes. As an example say relay2 is off, the circuit is closed, and Switch1's state will is 1. If relay2 is toggled to on the circuit will open and Switch1's state will change to 0.  
Switch2 | The push button on the smart switch. Using Switch instead of button seems to provide a quicker response. 

### Device Configuration
There are a couple things we need to do to get this switch to work correctly. 

#### SwitchTopic
This is normally set to 0 by default. This is the desired value. I recommend runnning anyways to make sure it is set. 
```console
SwitchTopic 0
```

For more information about SwitchTopic you can find it here: https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Buttons-and-Switches/#switchtopic

#### SwitchMode
Setting Switch 1 to SwitchMode 1 will keep Relay 1 in sync with the status of the power. When the state of the cirucit is changed that will change Switch1 and in turn chagne Relay1.
Setting Switch 2 to SwitchMode 5 will allow it to toggle the power and gives access to the HOLD option.

```console
switchmode1 0
switchmode2 5
```

For more information about SwitchMode you can find it here: https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Buttons-and-Switches/#switchmode

### Rules Configuration

#### Rule1
When relay 3 changes state this will toggle relay 2. If relay 3 doesn't change state when then nothging happens. 
```console
Backlog Rule1 ON Power3#State do Power2 2 endon ON switch2#state=3 DO publish stat/tasmota_XXXXX/SWITCH1T {"TRIG":"HOLD"} ENDON; Rule1 1
```

#### Rule2
Keeps relay3 in synch with relay1 but, rule1 has to be disabled while updateing the state and then reenabled. 
```console
Backlog Rule2 ON Power1#state do Backlog rule1 0; power3 0; rule 1 1 endon On Powe1#state=1 do Backlog rule1 0: power3 1: rule1 1 endon; Rule2 1
```
#### Rule3
For explicit on / off and toggle rule3. When an event is received Relay3 will only change if it's not already in the matching state.
```console
Backlog Rule3 ON event#OFF do power3 0 endon ON event#ON do power3 1 endon ON event#TOGGLE do power3 2 endon; Rule3 1
```

### Home Assistant Configuration

**SetOption19 should not be used in this setup!**

SetOption19 will expose both relays and will become very confusing to what the switch state is. 

#### Switch Confiugration
Below is an example I used to get this configuration working in Home assistant. 

```console
switch:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Exterior Lights"
    state_topic: "stat/tasmota_XXXXX/POWER1"
    command_topic: "cmnd/tasmota_XXXXX/EVENT"
    availability_topic: "tele/tasmota_XXXXX/LWT"
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    payload_available: "Online"
    payload_not_available: "Offline"
```

Topic | Description
----- | -----------
state_topic | is based on the dummy relay on the smart switch. This is what tells Home Assistant if the light is on or off.
command_topic | This is what Home assistent will use to trigger [Rule3](#Rule3) on the device via MQTT.
