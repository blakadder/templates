## Home Assistant Integration
Set a rule 

```console                 
Backlog Rule1 on tuyareceived#dptype4id3 do publish stat/%topic%/speed %value% endon on tuyareceived#dptype4id2 do publish stat/%topic%/mode %value% endon; Rule1 1
```

1. Add the following to Home Assistant to your FAN section, replace `%topic%` with device topic:

```yaml
{% raw %}- platform: mqtt
  name: "Flat Bedroom Fan"
  state_topic: "stat/%topic%/POWER1"
  command_topic: "cmnd/%topic%/POWER1"
  oscillation_state_topic: "stat/%topic%/POWER2" 
  oscillation_command_topic: "cmnd/%topic%/POWER2"
  payload_on: 'ON'
  payload_off: 'OFF'
  payload_oscillation_on: 'ON'
  payload_oscillation_off: 'OFF'
  percentage_state_topic: "stat/%topic%/speed"
  percentage_command_topic: "cmnd/%topic%/TuyaSend4"
  percentage_command_template: "3,{{ value }}"
  speed_range_min: 0
  speed_range_max: 3
  preset_modes:
    - breeze
    - sleep
    - normal
    - smart
  preset_mode_state_topic: "stat/%topic%/mode"
  preset_mode_value_template: "{%set m=value|int%}{%if m==0%}breeze{%elif m==1%}sleep{%elif m==2%}normal{%elif m==3%}smart{%else%}Unknown{%endif%}"
  preset_mode_command_topic: "cmnd/%topic%/TuyaSend4"
  preset_mode_command_template: >-
    3,
    {% if value == 'breeze' %}
    0
    {% elsif value == 'sleep' %}
    1
    {% elsif value == 'normal' %}
    2
    {% elsif value == 'smart' %}
    3
    {% endif %}
  availability:
    - topic: "tele/%topic%/LWT"
    - payload_available: "Online"
    - payload_not_available: "Offline"{% endraw %}
```    

Note: Home Assistant only has one oscilation command/topic per fan.  The example above will allow control of the horizontal direction.  To control the vertical direction, change POWER2 to POWER3.
