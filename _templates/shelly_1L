## Flashing Shelly device OTA without serial connection

Any Shelly devices can be reflashed to the latest Tasmota OTA without physical connection with the
help of [mgos-to-tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/mgos-to-tasmota).

Your Shelly device must be connected to your Wifi, configured with gateway and DNS and have access
to the Internet. Be sure to have a reliable power connection as well as a reliable Wifi connection.
Power or Wifi loss will make your device unresponsive and recovery will go through serial flashing.

- Open a web browser to your Shelly device
- In the address bar of your browser type the following :<br>
  `http://shellyip/ota?url=http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/shelly/mg2tasmota-Shelly1L.zip`<br>
  replace `shellyip` with the actual IP address of your Shelly.

After flashing, which can take a few minutes, the Shelly device will restart with lastest Tasmota
and create an AP `tasmota-XXXXX`. From there follow standard configuration procedure. Don't forget
to enter the template at the end of the configuration.
