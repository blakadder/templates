You need to configure these rules to control the relays. The ones defined in the template are just virtual relays!

```console
rule1 
on System#Boot do Baudrate 115200 endon
on SerialReceived#Data=41542B5253540D0A do SerialSend5 5749464920434f4e4e45435445440a5749464920474f542049500a41542b4349504d55583d310a41542b4349505345525645523d312c383038300a41542b43495053544f3d333630 endon
on Power1#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00101A2 endon
on Power1#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00100A1 endon
on Power2#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00201A3 endon
on Power2#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00200A2 endon
on Power3#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00301A4 endon
on Power3#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00300A3 endon
on Power4#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00401A5 endon
on Power4#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00400A4 endon
```

Make sure to enable the rule: `rule1 1`
