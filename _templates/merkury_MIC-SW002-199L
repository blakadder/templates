Module is ESP8266, specifically ESP-12E ""TUYA"".  Pinouts readily available online or [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-pinout-reference-gpios/).

TUYA-CONVERT may work if you are lucky enough to have an old unit that didn't get a firmware update or newer module.  I used a serial connection and Tasmotizer.

Make the serial connections and jumper GPIO0 to ground to enable flashing, before you apply power.  Once it's booted you can remove the jumper.

Appears to be almost identical to the [MI-SW001-199](https://templates.blakadder.com/merkury_MI-SW001-199.html)
