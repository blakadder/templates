If your bulb does not match the pictures below, check if you have the newer [v3 version](https://templates.blakadder.com/teckin_SB50-2.html) of the bulb.

As of October 2020, `tuya-convert` no longer works on this bulb due to a manufacturer firmware update.
Opened up the bulb to see if serial flashing was an option, but could not solder wires without destroying the fixture.
If you find a way to serial flash without removing the PCB board, please update this page.

Note there are two diffusers. 
The outer one should pop off after a few rotations, but the inner one may be glued on. 
A flat-head screwdriver will help remove the inner one.
