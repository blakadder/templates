## Flashing

![Pinout](/assets/device_images/sonoff_tx_ultimate_pinout.webp)

There are pin holes for 3V3, TX, RX and GND. You can flash without soldering by inserting a 4 pin header and apply sideways pressure to maintain contact. You will need to ground the BOOT pad during flashing process so an extra pair of hands might be needed. 

## Touch Panel Driver

Download the [TX Ultimate](https://github.com/blakadder/tx-ultimate/) driver file [`txultimate.be`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blakadder/tx-ultimate/main/txultimate.be). Navigate to **Consoles - Manage File system** in the web UI. Upload the driver to TX Ultimate with "Choose file" followed by "Start Upload".

To load the driver on startup select **Create and edit new file** named `autoexec.be` with a line `load("txultimate.be")`. Alternatively you can rename `txultimate.be` to `autoexec.be`

Driver is just recognising touch events for now and reports them to the RESULT topic.

## LED and Haptic Motor

Control the haptic feedback motor with [`Buzzer`](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#buzzer) command

Set the proper LED count with `Pixels 27`. If you want advanced control over LEDs like custom effect and segmenting you need to program them with [Berry](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Berry_Addressable-LED/). If you do build new effects please share them one the [driver GitHub](https://github.com/blakadder/tx-ultimate/)

## I2S Audio Support

Best results are with using `I2SSay` for text-to-speech or `I2SRtttl` to play [RTTTL tones](https://picaxe.com/rtttl-ringtones-for-tune-command/). Audio file playback sounds terrible and is very noisy but a fix is found and will be available soon.

To have I2S audio support you will need to compile a custom binary.

Add a new environment to `platformio_override.ini` or `platformio_tasmota_cenv.ini`

```ini
[env:tasmota32-txultimate]
extends                 = env:tasmota32_base
board_build.f_cpu       = 240000000L
build_flags             = ${env:tasmota32_base.build_flags}
                          -DOTA_URL='"-"'
                          -DCODE_IMAGE_STR='"txultimate"'
                          -DUSE_I2S_AUDIO
                          -DUSE_I2S_LSB ; Audio fix
                          -DUSE_I2S_SAY_TIME
                          -DUSE_I2S_WEBRADIO
                          -DUSE_I2S_RTTTL
;                          -DUSE_MATTER_DEVICE ; uncomment this line for Matter support
```

## Linking it All Together

No feature of the original firmware are replicated. You have total freedom to adapt the switch to your need with [Rules](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Rules) or additional [Berry](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Berry/) functions or a combination of both.

For example you can do set any short press to toggle the relay and LEDs, vibrate twice and say click

```console
rule1 on TXultimate#Action=Short do Backlog Buzzer 1,2; Power1 2; Power2 2; I2SSay activated endon
```

### esphome support

[smarthomeyourself.de](https://smarthomeyourself.de/sonoff-tx-ultimate-mit-esphome-custom-component/) has built a custom component for esphome and it works great. Thanks to him I've managed to add support to Tasmota.
