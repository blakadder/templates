## Hardware

The chip used on this board is a WB3S, and requires a transplant. It cannot be flashed. The daughterboard for the SoC is compatible with the ESP12-S and in this case ESP-C3-12F module. Other formats may be compatible, but may require jumper wires.

## Serial Flashing

Please see the [Hardware Preparation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/#hardware-preparation) page for general instructions.
