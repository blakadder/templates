As sold by the German hardware store "Globus Baumarkt".

## Setup

The controller can be easily opened by carefully prying on the left and right where the cables come out.

> tl;dr: Replace module, 10kΩ resistor between GPIO16 and VCC, 4.7kΩ resistor between GPIO15 and GND and blue wire to GPIO5.

You need to replace the WB3S Tuya module with an ESP module of the same form factor. I used an ESP-12E.

The 10kΩ resistor is needed for the button to work, otherwise Tasmota thinks it is pressed all the time (and resets after 40 seconds).
The 4.7kΩ resistor is needed for the ESP8266 to boot.

The IR sensor is connected to GPIO15 by default, but with the resistor in place it no longer works. 
The easiest way around this is to solder the blue wire from the sensor directly to GPIO5, which is the pin right next to its original position.

## Rules

```
Rule1
ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F740BF do power off ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7C03F do power on ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F700FF do dimmer + ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7807F do dimmer - ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F720DF do color2 ff0000 ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7A05F do color2 00ff00 ENDON
ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7609F do color2 0000ff ENDON
```

```
