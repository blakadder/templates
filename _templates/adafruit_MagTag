An ESP32-S2 dev board with a 2.9" E-Paper display, various peripherals, and standard GPIO/I2C connectors for rapid prototyping.

This board uses an [`ESP32-S2-WROVER`](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s2-wrover_esp32-s2-wrover-i_datasheet_en.pdf) module with 4 MB flash and 2 MB PSRAM.

When the board is booted into debug by holding `BOOT` and pressing the `RESET` button the USB port exposes a serial connection. This can be used to easily flash new firmware.
