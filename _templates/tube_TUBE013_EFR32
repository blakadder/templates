To use this device, you have to compile Tasmota with Ethernet enabled. A precompiled binary from development branch is availiable [here](https://github.com/tasmota/install/tree/main/firmware/unofficial).

Zigbee coordinator based on ESP32 and EFR32

## Self-compile Tasmota for this device

You need to self compile with the following options, either in `my_user_config.h` or in `user_config_override.h`, using `tasmota32` as a base firmware.

```c
#define USE_ZIGBEE      // Enable serial communication with Zigbee CC2530 flashed with ZNP
#undef USE_ZIGBEE_ZNP
#define USE_ZIGBEE_EZSP

#define USE_UFILESYS    // use file system

// WT32-ETH01
#define USE_ETHERNET
#undef  ETH_TYPE
#define ETH_TYPE        0   // ETH_PHY_LAN8720
#undef  ETH_CLKMODE
#define ETH_CLKMODE     0   // ETH_CLOCK_GPIO0_IN
#undef  ETH_ADDRESS
#define ETH_ADDRESS     1
```

## Flash firmware

Good news is that you don't need any wires to flash Tasmota on this device.

1. Connect the gateway to a ethernet cable which has access you your local network.
2. Power on the gateway with a micro usb cable and power supply. The link lights on the ethernet port will start blinking as it tries to negotiate a connection with your home network router.
3. Determine the device's ip address If your local network supports .local mdns addresses, the devices can be reached that way: tube_zb_gw_cc2652p2.local

Click on **OTA Update** -> **Choose File**, select the tasmota32 firmware and click **Update**

The device will reboot and enter AP mode. Configure Tasmota WIFI the regular way.

## Configure Tasmota template

Configure the template:

```
Backlog Module 0; Template {"NAME":"Tube ZB EFR32","GPIO":[0,0,0,3840,0,3552,1,0,0,0,0,0,5536,3584,5600,0,0,0,0,5568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5793,5792,0,0,0,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1}
```

## Flash EZSP 6.7.9 on the EFR32

The device comes pre-flashed with EZSP 6.9.1_2 but there are unresolved issues with Tasmota and we currently only support 6.7.x.
You need to downgrade the flash firmware to 6.7.9.

Download the following file: https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/blob/development/tools/fw_TubeZigbee_efr32/MGM210PA32JIA_ncp-uart-sw_6.7.9.gbl
Make sure to download the file as binary. The file size should be 206672 bytes long.

Click on **OTA Update** -> **Choose File**, select the tasmota32 firmware and click **Update**. Tasmota automatically detects the file type and flashes the EFR32 MCU.

Enjoy!
