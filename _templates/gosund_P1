With this template the Main device button is used to control the on/off of the USB ports
  
3 analog buttons also need a rule to control the relays, I've used range because the values have been stable.
```
Rule2 
  ON Analog#A0div10<30 DO Power3 2 BREAK 
  ON Analog#A0div10<60 DO Power2 2 BREAK 
  ON Analog#A0div10<80 DO Power1 2 ENDON
```

Then enable it with `Backlog Rule1 1; Rule2 1; Rule2 5`
