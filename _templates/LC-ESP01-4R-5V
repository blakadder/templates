### Flashing
Remove ESP01 from the relay PCB and connect it to your USB-to-serial adapter according to the image and flash Tasmota on it.

You need to configure these rules to control the relays. The ones defined in the template are just virtual relays!
```console
Rule1 
on Power1#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00101A2 endon on Power1#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00100A1 endon on Power2#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00201A3 endon on Power2#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00200A2 endon on Power3#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00301A4 endon on Power3#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00300A3 endon on Power4#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00401A5 endon on Power4#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00400A4 endon
```

Make sure to enable the rule:
```console
Rule1 1
```
If relays still donâ€™t switch try BaudRate 9600
