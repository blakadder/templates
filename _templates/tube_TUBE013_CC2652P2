To use this device, you have to compile Tasmota with Ethernet enabled. [Download](https://github.com/tasmota/install/tree/main/firmware/unofficial) unofficial precompiled firmware from development branch.

Zigbee coordinator based on ESP32 and CC2652p2

## Self-compile Tasmota for this device

You need to self compile with the following options, either in `my_user_config.h` or in `user_config_override.h`, using `tasmota32` as a base firmware.

```c
#define USE_ZIGBEE      // Enable serial communication with Zigbee CC2530 flashed with ZNP
#undef USE_ZIGBEE_EZSP  // Ensure ZNP support and not EZSP

#define USE_UFILESYS    // use file system

// WT32-ETH01
#define USE_ETHERNET
#undef  ETH_TYPE
#define ETH_TYPE        0   // ETH_PHY_LAN8720
#undef  ETH_CLKMODE
#define ETH_CLKMODE     0   // ETH_CLOCK_GPIO0_IN
#undef  ETH_ADDRESS
#define ETH_ADDRESS     1
```

## Flash firmware

Good news is that you don't need any wires to flash Tasmota on this device.

The device comes ZStack-3 pre-flashed on CC2652P2, and ESPhome pre-flashed on ESP32. You can simply use the OTA feature of ESPHome to flash Tasmota32.

1. Connect the gateway to a ethernet cable which has access you your local network.
2. Power on the gateway with a micro usb cable and power supply. The link lights on the ethernet port will start blinking as it tries to negotiate a connection with your home network router.
3. Determine the device's ip address If your local network supports .local mdns addresses, the devices can be reached that way: tube_zb_gw_cc2652p2.local

Click on **OTA Update** -> **Choose File**, select the tasmota32 firmware and click **Update**

The device will reboot and enter AP mode. Configure Tasmota WIFI the regular way.

## Configure Tasmota template

Finally configure the template:

```
Backlog Module 0; Template {"NAME":"Tube ZB CC2652","GPIO":[0,0,0,3840,0,3584,0,0,0,0,0,0,5536,3552,5600,0,0,0,0,5568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3840,5792,0,0,0,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1}
```

Enjoy!
