This is an 8x32 addressable LED display with built in battery, buzzer, RTC clock chip, light, temperature and humidity sensor.

After applying the template use command `Pixels 256` to set number of LEDs.

`GPI034` - ADC Input is the battery level but it's in raw state right now, you would need to use ADC Range and make calculations to get somewhat accurate voltage values.

To use the pixel display in Tasmota see [ArtNet control](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/ArtNet/) or [Addressable LED's in Berry](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Berry_Addressable-LED/).

RTC requires a custom compiled binary with support of [DS3321](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/DS3231/)

## OTA Flash

Go to http://clock.local web UI, go to ***About - Upgrade*** and upload tasmota32.bin. After the UI announces the upgrade is finished shut down the display by holding the left and right button. Power it on the same way, you should hear a constant whine noise when its powered on. Configure as any other Tasmota device. When you apply the template the whine noise will stop. 

As a final step download [`Partition_Wizard.tapp`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arendst/Tasmota/development/tasmota/berry/modules/Partition_Wizard.tapp), upload it to Tasmota file system and restart. Navigate to ***Consoles -> Partition Wizard*** and start the migration process to adapt the filesystem to Tasmota.

## Serial Flash

It can be easily flashed using the USB-C port in the back via [Tasmota Web Installer](https://tasmota.github.io/install) or any other serial flashing method.
