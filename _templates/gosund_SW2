In order to be able to flash the device from the pins, make sure to disconnect the front panel from the rest of the device. If not done, the tuya MCU will prevent the ESP chip to be flash.

To use the script, you have to compile Tasmota with [Scripting](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Scripting-Language) enabled. [Download](https://github.com/tasmota/install/tree/main/firmware/unofficial) unofficial precompiled firmware from development branch.

All dimming and on/off functionality is controlled by an MCU that does not follow the Tuya protocol.  Dimming and on/off can be set by Tasmota using simple serial commands.  Reading local dimming when set by the capacitive touch panel requires a Script-enabled build and the script below to process serial status codes sent by the dimmer MCU.

Status codes take the form of 24xx012123, with xx ranging from 01 to 64 (hex 1-100).

Minimum dimming level may vary by light fixture - adjust the ‘off’ value to match your setup in the >D section.

```lua
>D 100
rng=235
dimh=""
slider=0
power=0
dimval=1
a=""
b=""
c=""
d=0
f=0
g=""
;set the hex code below to the largest value possible that will turn off the relay with SerialSend5
off=0x7f

>B
dp0
rng-=off
=#scDim(dimval)

>E
a=SerialReceived
if sl(a)>0
then
g=sb(a 0 2)
if sl(a)==47
then
b=sb(a -5 2)
else
b=sb(a -8 2)
endif
a=""
if g=="24"
then
f=hd(b)
=>dimmer %f%
slider=f
dimval=slider
=#scDim(dimval)
=>SerialSend5 %dimh%
endif
else
slider=Dimmer
if chg[slider]>0
then
; dim according slider
if slider>0 and dimval!=slider
then
dimval=slider
=#scDim(dimval)
=>SerialSend5 %dimh%
endif
endif
endif

if pwr[1]!=power
then
if pwr[1]==1
then
=>SerialSend5 %dimh%
power=1
else
=>Serialsend5 00
power=0
endif
endif

#scDim(dimval)
dimh=hn((rng*dimval/100)+off)
=>print Scaled brightness is %dimh%
```

Alternatively, you can flash with a 9.0.0 version of tasmota customized for this switch. It is a bit simpler, since it requires no scripting, just choosing the module Gosund Dimmer (76), and fixes a bug in this setup.

Bought on Amazon pack of 2 switch dimmer. Model is written DS1. try All the info with special firmware or with the latest tasmota + the script and the dimmer does not correctly work. 
look like the gosund DS1 is and upgrade of SW2 and some hardware change prevent working correctly with provided infos, waiting to get update to fix
