### Configuration
The red LED (D5) on the relay board should be on otherwise the module will not receive commands and relays will not switch.

If the blue LED (D5)is on instead of the red one, power off the module then hold down S1 button and power it back on. 
You need to configure these rules to control the relays. The ones defined in the template are just virtual relays!

```console
Rule1 
on System#Boot do SerialSend5 0 endon
on Power1#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00101A2 endon
on Power1#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00100A1 endon
on Power2#State=1 do SerialSend5 A00201A3 endon
on Power2#State=0 do SerialSend5 A00200A2 endon
```
Make sure to enable the rule:
```console
Rule1 1
```

If relays still don't switch try `BaudRate 9600`
