Opening the device is not too hard but does take 15mins of patience!  There are no screws and the 2 part shell is glued/welded together.  To separate, find the seam at the back and very carefully use a sharp instrument to prize the seam to beak the seal.  Once you have started it's fairly easy to run around this seam with plastic/metal spudgers.

Once inside, remove existing WiFi module and replace with a [ESP-02S](ESP-02S) or similar
