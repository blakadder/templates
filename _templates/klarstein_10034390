This is a Tuya panel heater. It comes in white (model 10034390) an black (model 10034391)

<!--- Identified with MCU Product ID: `{"p":"3slpirlnlqp0bqo1","v":"1.0.0"}`. -->

## Serial Flashing
Easily disassembled by removing the front glass panel by unscrewing 4 screws on the side. The PCB with the display and touch control has a [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) module on smaller PCB. The control MCU is on the back of the PCB.

Connect your USB-to-serial adapter to [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/TYWE3S) module using 3V3, GND, TX and RX pins and flash. The MCU should not interfere if you're powering the Wi-Fi module directly on its 3V3 pin.

## Device Configuration

Please read [TuyaMCU](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU) article to understand the terminology and configuration process.

Change device to a TuyaMCU module (or apply the provided template, result is the same)
```console
Module 54
```

Implement this rule to stop the Wi-Fi display icon from blinking randomly
```console
rule1 on system#boot do ruletimer 200 endon on rules#timer=1 do backlog event fix; ruletimer 3600 endon on event#fix do backlog serialsend5 55aa0008000007; serialsend5 55aa000300010205; serialsend5 55aa000300010306; tuyasend8 endon
```
## Functions
- `dpID 1` controls device power - turns the device on off      
- `dpID 2` sets target temperature    
- `dpID 3` reports ambient temperature using the built in temperature sensor    
- `dpID 4` control heating modes:     
  - `0` - high 
  - `1` - low
  - `2` - off
- `dpID 5` control ECO mode (on or off)     
- `dpID 6` control child lock mode (lock on device controls)     
- `dpID 10` heating timer in hours     
- `dpID 11` heating timer in minutes     
- `dpID 12` error report    
- `dpID 101` unknown?!    
- `dpID 102` turns display on or off (it will turn off automatically after some time)    
- `dpID 103` temperature unit select and heating control: 
  - `0` - Celsius 
  - `1` - Fahrenheit
  - `2..` - toggles heating while keeping dpid4. it is not reliable since it always toggles but there is no response on what the current state is 

### Configuration

```console
backlog tuyamcu 11,1; tuyamcu 12,5; tuyamcu 13,6; tuyamcu 71,3; tuyamcu 72,2; tuyamcu 61,4, tempres 0
```

- `Relay1` maps to dpID1 for power control
- `Relay2` maps to dpID5 for ECO mode
- `Relay3` maps to dpID6 for Child Lock mode

In the webUI an ambient temperature sensor and temperature set sensor will be shown.

Set temperature using `TuyaSend2 2,x` where x is the desired temperature (0 decimals allowed).

Label webUI buttons:
```console
backlog webbutton1 Power; webbutton2 ECO; webbutton3 Child Lock
```
### TuyaEnum 
As of Tasmota 9.1.0.1 [#9769](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/pull/9769) it is possible to map Type4 dpIDs (such as dpID4) to an Enum fn ID. 

Map dpID4 to Enum1 fnID:
```console
TuyaMCU 61,4
```
Set Enum1 range (in this case the max enum is 2). 
```console
TuyaEnumList 1,2
```

Now you can control the heating mode with `TuyaEnum1 <x>` where `x` is 0/1/2. If you try a number outside the Enum1 range it will throw an error.

To do the same for temperature unit select do `TuyaMCU 62,103` then `TuyaEnumList 2,1`. Control with `TuyaEnum2 0/1`.
