23/12/2019 *** WARNING *** This model can now be supplied without power monitoring and it does not use the ESP8266 chip. This means it CANNOT be flashed with Tasmota by any method. See this blog post over at Scargill's Tech Blog https://tech.scargill.net/teckin-sp23-smart-socket/
Works with Tuya OTA

The Teckin SP23 appears to be a clone of the BlitzWolf SHP2 hardware with Tuya software / firmware.

The uses an ESP8266EX and is capable of switching up to 16 amps at 250 VAC.

2 Teckin SP23s (marked V1.2) [bought from Amazon UK in January 2019](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TECKIN-Outlet-Wireless-Control-Required/dp/B07CVJYV3G) have been flashed successfully and use BlitzWolf SHP2 Sonoff configuration. Voltage calibration may be required for accurate power monitoring.
Confirm flashing a box of 4 purchased yesterday (09/11/19), from Amazon UK, with Tasmota 7.0.0.4, using tuya-convert v2.2.0. No version number visible on the plugs.

## Serial Flash Instructions

No hardware preparation is required to flash if you are confident about having the same version and can easily be flashed following the procedure detailed at [**here**](https://github.com/SynAckFin/TuyOTA/wiki/Walkthrough) using https://github.com/SynAckFin/TuyOTA

## How to disassemble if desired:

If you wish to confirm you have the same hardware the Teckin SP23 can be opened by hitting each side of the plug at the lip with a rubber mallet or similar. This will leave a visually unblemished enclosure which can be resecured with superglue or similar.
