***WARNING*** Some versions of Teckin SP23 come without power monitoring and do not use ESP8266. Those cannot be flashed with Tasmota.


The Teckin SP23 appears to be a clone of the BlitzWolf SHP2 hardware with Tuya software / firmware.

The uses an ESP8266EX and is capable of switching up to 16 amps at 250 VAC.

2 Teckin SP23s (marked V1.2) [bought from Amazon UK in January 2019](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TECKIN-Outlet-Wireless-Control-Required/dp/B07CVJYV3G) have been flashed successfully and use BlitzWolf SHP2 Sonoff configuration. Voltage calibration may be required for accurate power monitoring.
Confirm flashing a box of 4 purchased yesterday (09/11/19), from Amazon UK, with Tasmota 7.0.0.4, using tuya-convert v2.2.0. No version number visible on the plugs.

## Serial Flash Instructions

No hardware preparation is required to flash if you are confident about having the same version and can easily be flashed following the procedure detailed at [**here**](https://github.com/SynAckFin/TuyOTA/wiki/Walkthrough) using https://github.com/SynAckFin/TuyOTA

## How to disassemble if desired:

If you wish to confirm you have the same hardware the Teckin SP23 can be opened by hitting each side of the plug at the lip with a rubber mallet or similar. This will leave a visually unblemished enclosure which can be resecured with superglue or similar.
