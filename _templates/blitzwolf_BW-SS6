This device uses the LM1 tuya chip which is based on the ESP8266EX chipset.

Using this template turns the unit into a simple 2-gang switch (eg. like BW-SS5 [2 gang]).

To operate the unit as a roller shutter switch, the following commands should be issued: 
* enable `Interlock 1,2` 
* activate `Interlock on`
* set the switches to follow and inverse `SwitchMode1 2` and `SwitchMode2 2`. Check [SwitchModes documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Buttons-and-Switches/#switchmode) for details.
* Then the device should be calibrated for the distance of your curtains, have a look at [Blinds and Shutters](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Blinds-and-Shutters/) configuration page.

### Serial Flashing
It is possible to flash the unit serial method using an USB-TTL adapter.
The I/O wiring endpoints are available in the images below, no soldering is required.
