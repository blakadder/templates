This device is very similar to the [EU version](https://templates.blakadder.com/ledvance_4058075522800.html)

It offers power metering with a BL0937 chip, however the voltage reading was only achievable by using the HLWBL CF1 component in the template.
Consider power monitoring calibration for accurate readings.

Case opening starts with the removal to the small white rubber plug with an ale or small screw driver on the back side. Behind is a triangle shaped screw, to be removed. The case is not glued and the back plate is just clipped in to the case. It can be removed by inserting a thin applicator or flat screw driver to bend the side walls and the wall opposite to the screw gently away until the the clips release the plate.

The soldered chip module WB2S (which can't be flashed with tasmota) needs to be replaced with a TYWE2S (ESP compatible with matching pinout - get it on ). With respective tooling and basic solder know-how flashing is pretty straight forward (https://www.bfrankict.net/index.php/2021/01/31/tywe2s-serial-flashing/ - consider the comment section as well to get the chip into flash mode:  bridge pins  IO0 + GND).
