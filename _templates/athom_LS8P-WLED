Comes pre-flashed with WLED but easy to flash with Tasmota using the web UI upgrade option.

I2S PDM Digital Microphone Built in, IR Remote Control (optional)

## Flashing Tasmota

The Athom device coomes pre-flashed with WLED. It is easy to flash Tasmota instead - no soldering required.

Step 0. Download the standard Tasmota32 firmware from here: http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota32/tasmota32.bin

Step 1. Power the device, connect the Wifi AP with a laptop. It should be called `WLED_0xxxxxx`. If you see an auto-connect page, close it.

Step 2. Connect to http://4.3.2.1/ you should see the WLED Admin page. Click on `TO THE CONTROLS`

Step 3. Click on `Config` (wheel). Then click on `Security & Updates` at the bottom of the page.

Step 4. Click on `Manual OTA Update`. Click on `Choose a File` and select the `tasmtoa32.bin` file.

Step 5. Click on the `Update!` button to flash Tasmota. Wait 20s for the device to reboot.

**Now Tasmota is flashed on the device**. Go through the normal configuration process of Tasmota (connect to Wifi `tasmota-xxxxxx-yyyy`)

To finish configuration, click on `Configuration` then `Auto-configuration`. Select `Athom Adressable LED` in the dropdown, click on `Apply configuration`. Confirm the reboot and clikc on `Ok`.

## Migrating to Safeboot partition layout

Once Tasmota restarts, it's still using the original partition layout, and not the [Safeboot layout](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Safeboot/).

If you want to setup the new Safeboot partition layout follow the steps below:

- Download the Parition Wizard app, in the Console type `UrlFetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arendst/Tasmota/development/tasmota/berry/modules/Partition_Wizard.tapp`. It should return `RESULT = {"UrlFetch":"Done"}`
- Restart the device
- Click on `Consoles`, then `Partition Wizard`.
- Click on the red button `Start migration` with default parameters
- Wait for 5 minutes
- Reconnect to the device. You are good now...

## Using the device

The Athom device has a Relay to power off the LED strips and reduce power consumption when the LEDs are not used. Using WS23812 LEDs needs the first relay to be `On`
