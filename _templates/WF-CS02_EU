Added some rules to get the switch working, based on https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Blinds-and-Shutters:

```console
SetOption80 1 # Enable shutter support, reset the device after for correct interface to show up

ShutterRelay1 1 # Enable shutter relay 1

Backlog PulseTime1 0; PulseTime2 0 # ShutterMode0

Backlog Interlock 1,2; Interlock ON

PowerRetain 1 # Save state for Home Assistant

Rule1 on Power3#State=1 do backlog ShutterStop1; Power3 0 endon # Use the middle button for stopping shutter movement

Rule1 1

WebButton3 ■ # Set stop symbol for the third button in the web GUI

SwitchMode1 4 # Make the buttons do their actions on touch, not release

SwitchMode2 4

SwitchMode3 4
```

Do the calibration as per instructions in Tasmota documentation.

Flashing the device using TuyaConvert worked in this case even though multiple devices were manufactured in October 2019.
There are no prebuilt Tasmota binaries with native shutter support included, so Tasmota must be compiled manually with the correct flag for this functionality to be present. Instructions for this can also be found in Tasmota documentation.

The shutter can now be integrated into Home Assistant:

```yaml

cover:
    platform: mqtt
    name: "Shutter 1"
    availability_topic: "tele/<tasmota>/LWT"
    payload_available: "Online"
    payload_not_available: "Offline"
    position_topic: "stat/<tasmota>/SHUTTER1"
    position_open: 100
    position_closed: 0
    set_position_topic: 'cmnd/<tasmota>/ShutterPosition1'
    command_topic: "cmnd/<tasmota>/Backlog"
    value_template: '{{ value | int }}'
    payload_open: "ShutterOpen1"
    payload_close: "ShutterClose1"
    payload_stop: "ShutterStop1"
    retain: false
    optimistic: false
    qos: 1

```
