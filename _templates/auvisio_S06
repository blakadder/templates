## Warning 
There are two versions available from pearl.de under the same name.

Model URC-150.app (NX-4519-905): Without temperature and humidity sensors, equipped with TYWE3S and fully supported
Model URC-180.app (ZX-5104-905): Equipped with temmperature and humidity sensors, uses WB3S and is not supported

Both models have a very similar case. The one that comes with perforated head is the one which is not supported.
