## Warning (new S06 devices)
There are new unbranded S06 devices that come with Beken BK7231N chipsets on a CBU or CB3S module.  
These device versions are not supported by Tasmota, but could be flashed with OpenBK or Tuya CloudCutter.

## Warning (older devices)
There are two versions available from pearl.de under the same name.

Model URC-150.app (NX-4519-905): Without temperature and humidity sensors, equipped with TYWE3S and fully supported
Model URC-180.app (ZX-5104-905): Equipped with temmperature and humidity sensors, uses WB3S and is not supported

Both models have a very similar case. The one that comes with perforated head is the one which is not supported.
