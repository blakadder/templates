As of 2024-07-15 you need to replace the module (uses unsupported CB3S).

~~Tutorial to flash Tuya Motion PIR - No Solder Method~~

~~[![Tasmota Firmware - Flashing USB Serial - No Solder Method with Tasmotizer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JOPKtN9ajek/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOPKtN9ajek)~~

My device came with a blue led cover due the image is for red.

To get the PIR to send a proper on/off status, set the switch mode to 2
```console
SwitchMode1 2
```

Buzzer is the alarm speaker

Switch1 is the PIR sensor

Relay1 is for the led light on/off

Not sure if the side button should be exposed somehow

Works powered over USB-C without the battries (they should be used as backup as instructed in the manual)
