## About
The Smartpoint Wifi Smart Remote Controller controls IR remote controlled devices from anywhere like TVs, Heaters, Air Conditioning Units, Fans, Stereos, etc... It has an IR blaster array, IR reciever and blue status LED.

## Note About Flashing

* On older models of this device, [tuya-convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert) should be able to flash this device, but I am unsure how old the device needs to be for this method to still work.
* On newer patched devices (likely yours), [tuya-convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert) will not work. In order to flash, gain access to the [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) board by prying off the top of the device and unscrewing the PCB from the plastic housing. On the underside of the PCB, the [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) board will reveal itself.
