`SetOption37 30` or the R and G will be reversed - 

Instructions in the box were wrong: To get into Discovery Mode -  Donâ€™t wait 10 seconds. Turn bulb on & off 3 times and wait 

Newer version, probably called "G45-2", isn't flashable with tuya-convert. Opening it might be as bad as with Feit Electric A19.
