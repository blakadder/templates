Recently purchased device had updated firmware and wouldn't tuya-convert. Was able to easily access the TYWE3L chip and flash successfully with solder method. Jig would work fine also.
WARNING: LED power module is identical at both ends and wire colours are Blue/Brown for both AC and DC ends.  Ensure you re-install the circuit board the same orientation it came out or you will destroy the DC power circuit and trip your safety switch (GFCI).
