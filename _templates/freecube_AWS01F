- New tuya firmware on device caused tuya-convert not to work. Purchased from link above on 1-10-2021. 
- Switch does not have wifi cut-out on paddle for led in this version, just a horizontal slot cut-out. 
- Flashed via serial, links to pin out pic below. TX/RX labeled on PCB.  

#### 2021-03-22

- Designed a small jig to help with flashing of the above-mentioned chip. Jig can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4803049)
- Small correction to the image above:
  - Ground pin is the rightmost pin along the `VCC` and `GPIO 0` side of the chip
  - RX pin is directly above the identified RX pin
  - TX pin is directly above the identified TX pin
