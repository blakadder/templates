I soldered leads to the 3.3V, GND, TX and RX pads were the daughter board connects to the main board. I also soldered a lead to IO0 so I could ground it while powering it up to get it into flash mode.

The outer case is connected to the inner case with a bunch of tabs around the edge. I pried them open with a small screwdriver. The outer case got pretty chewed up in the process. After removing the outer case, the board has to be removed from the inner case in order to access the places to solder leads."
