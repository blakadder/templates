A Feather form factor ESP32-S3 dev board with 1S LiPo battery monitoring.

This board uses an [`ESP32-S3-MINI-1-P1N8`](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3-mini-1_mini-1u_datasheet_en.pdf) module with 8MB of flash and no PSRAM.

When the board is booted into debug by holding `BOOT` and pressing the `RESET` button the USB-Serial chip on the USB port exposes a serial connection. This can be used to easily flash new firmware.
