Device contains a TYWE2S, soldering to the board will permit flashing, easily accessible without any damage to the enclosure using only phillips screws and plastic clips.

Recently Purchased from Bunnings.com.au and device now contains CB2S Module. Will need to replace with ESP-02S then Flash Tasmota
