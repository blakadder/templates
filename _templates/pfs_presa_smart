## Disassembly tips:

Be careful when you remove the glass plate as I broke the catches. 

You should have to enlarge the ground screw hole, as the screw will not allow the pcb to come out.

The PFS smart plug comes with a Tuya WB2S chip, you can simply remove it and replace it with a TYWE2S (ESP8285) chip, as they are essentially identical.
