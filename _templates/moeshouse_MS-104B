The device use frequency detection circuits connected to GPIO12 and GPIO13 of the LM1 ESP8266 chip. At the moment you have to use a script to make it work with Tasmota. Script is not supported with precompiled binary (at least 6.6.0) so you have to compile your own fw. Personally recommended gitpod: 

[https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler)

Below two scripts which do something like switchmode4 and switchmode1. The script for switchmode4 is created by @thxthx0 and modified by me for switchmode1

[**SwitchMode_1**](https://github.com/blakadder/templates/files/3640074/switchmode_1.txt) (txt file)
[**SwitchMode_4**](https://github.com/blakadder/templates/files/3640075/switchmode_4.txt) (txt file)

This device is based on Smart Life / Tuya App. Therefore Tuya-Convert might work if the device has not received the latest Tuya firmware updates. My has fw 1.0.2 so should be ok for hack. Otherwise is very easy access to serial interface:
