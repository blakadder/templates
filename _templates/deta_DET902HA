This light now uses a WB2L chip that can't be flashed.

Update September 2022: Most of these at Bunnings have now been replaced with new stock that contains the WB2L chip, however some old stock with the TWE2L (Tasmota compatible module) is still around
There is a very subtle difference in the packaging: on the bottom of the box the product code "DET902HA" is shown, which is the older stock. The new (non-Tasmota) units are labelled "DET902HA Series 2"
Note that this is the only place on the packaging the difference is shown. The product codes on the sides of the box are DET902HA for both models.
