Newer versions of this light use a WB2L chip that can't be flashed.

Older versions use an ESP8285 which can be flashed by serial, but not OTA. Note that serial flashing
requires some very precise soldering onto small surface pads on an awkwardly positioned daughterboard.

You can identify older versions - still available at some stockists - by looking at the underside of
the box. In the small table at the top, next to "Made in China" you should see the model number
DET902HA. If the model number appears on it's own - you can flash the devie. If it says anything else
next to it (Revision 2, Version 2 etc) it will not work. Note this device is also available in a four
pack, which makes no reference to revisions on the underside (whether it's old or new) - the only way
to know is to buy them and open them up. For this reason the individual packed units are preferable.
