I didn't enable shutter support because I don't need. Can't guarantee if this configuration works with shutter support.

```console
switchmode1 4 # enable toggle first switch (first button)
switchmode2 4 # enable toggle second switch (third button)

pulsetime1 130 # 30 seconds of pulsetime for first switch
pulsetime2 130 # 30 seconds of pulsetime for second switch
pulsetime3 0   # 0 seconds for central button (pause)

# IMPORTANT enable interlock for safety
Backlog Interlock 1,2,3; Interlock ON
```
