Seems to be identical to: https://blakadder.github.io/templates/geekbes_4socket.html

Button controls single relay only. Rule to emulate original button behaviour (make sure to have all relays set to off before adding the rule,  from then on it should work correctly across restarts):
```
Rule1
on system#boot do var1 %mem1% endon
on power1#state do event pwch=%value% endon
on power2#state do event pwch=%value% endon
on power3#state do event pwch=%value% endon
on power4#state do event pwch=%value% endon
on event#pwch=0 do sub1 1 endon
on event#pwch=1 do add1 1 endon
on var1#state do mem1 %value% endon
on button1#state do event press=%mem1% endon
on event#press>0 do backlog power1 0;power2 0;power3 0;power4 0; endon
on event#press<0.1 do backlog power1 1;power2 1;power3 1;power4 1; endon
```
