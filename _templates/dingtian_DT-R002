## Warning

When ordering this board ask for relay board with test firmware, otherwise the ESP32 will be locked.

Relay 1 is connected to GPIO 16 which is used for PSRAM in Tasmota, to prevent a pulse on Relay 1 upon boot use the tasmota32-nopsram firmware (https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/discussions/21266), or use "#define DISABLE_PSRAMCHECK true" in user_config_override.h upon building.

### Description

Dingtian relay boards are ESP32 based boards with 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 or 32 relays and inputs.

At the 2 and 4 relay boards the relays and inputs are directly connected to the gpio's of the ESP32.

### MQTT Messages

Inputs state are reported through SENSOR message at teleperiod:

```shell
MQT: tele/dingtian1/SENSOR = "{"Time":"2024-04-26T09:17:15","Switch1":"ON","Switch2":"ON"}"
```

Input changes are only reported when using switchmode 15 or 16:

```shell
 MQT: stat/dingtian1/SENSOR = {"Time":"2024-04-26T09:24:02","Switch1":"OFF","Switch2":"ON"} (retained)
```

When using switchmode 0, Input changes are not reported, but the output changes are reported:

```shell
 MQT: stat/dingtian1/RESULT = {"POWER1":"ON"}
```

### Ethernet
To use ethernet JL1101 use the template provided or you must set 
GPIO0  ETH-Power
GPIO18  ETH-MDIO
GPIO23  ETH-MDC

and commands: 
EthType 7  (JL1101)
ethernet 1

### Note

For using Modbus on the RS485 port (if ordered with this option) have a look at https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Modbus-Bridge/ and also add #define USE_MODBUS_BRIDGE and if desired #define USE_MODBUS_BRIDGE_TCP to user_config_override.h
