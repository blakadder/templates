Note : Just picked one of these up on Amazon, the onboard processor wouldn't program under Tasmotizer after I un-soldered it from the board, so I swapped in a regular ESP8266 pre-programmed and everything is working great with the above configuration.  Note there are only 5 relays in mine, the 6th outlet is always on as long as the master switch is powered.
