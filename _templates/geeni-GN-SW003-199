This device has a master switch on the corded end that controls power to the overall unit.
On the top of the unit is an LED indicating if any of the individual sockets has power on.
Additionally each socket has an LED that illuminates when power is on for that socket.

The main status LED is illuminated whenever any of the 6 sockets are powered on.

The outer case is secured with 8 Tri-angle security screws, but otherwise opens easily.
Inside is a single pcb secured with several small phillips screws.
