Originally has a RTL based WR3E Module, changing it to a ESP-12S does the trick, no other changes, except maybe you want to populate the two other LEDs but it's not necessary.
Bad circuit: opening the plate will expose contacts with live mains!
Some emit a high tone when a relay is active.
Front button plate is 55x55mm and will fit e.g. in German standard switch plates, although the matte optics may not fit to the rest.

Real Pinout:
- 0- LED3/R18, not populated
- 1- NC
- 2- NC
- 3- Relay for contact marked L2
- 4- LED2/R17, not populated
- 5- LED1, a blue one visible through a hole
- 12- S2, the center "On" button
- 13- S1, the "Up" button, PCB marking "open symbol"
- 14- S3, the "Down" button, PCB-marking "close symbol"
- 15- Relay for contact L1
- 16- NC
- 17- NC

I've set the template so that there is a dummy relay on GPIO2, so the LED can be Link and another function switched with the center button. I use it to switch Automatic and Manual mode, hence the WebButton rename command.
L1 is connected to motor "down", L2 is "up".

Additional setup:
`SO80 1; SO1 0; PowerOnState 0; WebButton 1 Auto; ShutterRelay1 2; Interlock on; Interlock 2,3; ShutterMode 1; ShutterButton1 2 up; ShutterButton1 3 down`
I've some used without MQTT in standalone Timer mode, the center button then is used to disable timers. To do this i added a simple rule `rule1 on system#boot do backlog power1 1; timers 1 endon on Power1#state do timers %value% endon`, this switches the timers on when power is applied, and they follow the power1 state."
