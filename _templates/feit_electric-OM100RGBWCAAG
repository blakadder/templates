## Safety/Heat Warning

**If you set all channels to FF you will burn out the bulb.**

The thermal management in this device is barely adequate and will likely have its effectiveness reduced by disassembly/reassembly. Be extra careful about this if you're running the white/CCT LEDs at the same time as the RGB LEDs or if you're aiming to use it at max brightness for long durations.

## Template Update

Some newer versions of this bulb use a slightly different PWM configuration for the CCT function. If your bulb's CCT slider has an odd dimming effect without properly controlling temperature, try applying the following template along with applying `SetOption92 1` then restarting.

```json
{"NAME":"OM100/RGBWW","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,416,419,0,0,417,452,418,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
```

This template differs from the original template above by inverting `PWM 5`. This, combined with enabling `SetOption92`, get the CCT function working properly and assure that the temperature slider matches the bulb's actual output curve.

## Tuya-Convert OTA Flashing

**Updated: 2021/10/31**

Newer versions of this bulb _cannot be OTA flashed_ via `tuya-convert` as of October 2021.

It seems unlikely at this point that Tuya's anti-OTA-flashing mitigations can be worked around so manual flashing will be required.

## Manual Flashing

This device uses an `ESP8266EX`-based Tuya [`TYWE3L` module](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/wifie3lpinmodule?id=K9605uj1ar87n). It can be [flashed manually](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU-Devices/) by attaching a UART adapter to VCC, GND, RX, and TX. To flash the device, make sure to _pull GPIO0 to ground_ on boot then release it for subsequent boots after flashing is complete.

### Disassembly Notes

Like most bulbs, a pull and a twist will get the diffusion dome off. Once that's off there's some silicone sealant to remove around the LED board. There are no screws to deal with. The LED board attaches to the power/MCU board with two four-pin board-to-board connectors.

Getting to the module requires a bit of work to remove potting but the potting Feit chose to use is a loose putty-like substance instead of rigid silicone. This may be part of the heat sinking strategy so its probably good idea put any removed putting material back where was on reassembly.

Once the potting is removed, a long, narrow soldering iron tip and a steady hand will be required unless you're able to craft a narrow jig to fit in there.

Reassembly requires some care to make sure that all of the long, surprisingly fragile pins on the board-to-board connectors remain straight and actually make it through the pin headers. Its may also be a good idea to carefully in some of the original potting material, making sure it makes solid contact with the back of the LED plate, to assist with heat dissipation.

### Firmware Notes

The factory firmware for this module sets the UART to _74880 baud_ instead of the usual 115200 baud. This doesn't have any effect when booting with GPIO0 pulled to ground - `esptool` and `Tasmotizer` work fine - but it can be confusing if you're trying to validate that the bulb's factory is working via UART.

This device has 2MB of flash.
