An IoT-focused ESP32-S2 dev board with a display, a variety of on-board peripherals, and standard GPIO/I2C connectors for rapid experimentation and development.

This board uses an [`ESP32-S2-WROVER`](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s2-wrover_esp32-s2-wrover-i_datasheet_en.pdf) module with 4 MB flash and 2 MB PSRAM.

When the board is booted into debug by holding `BOOT` (on the back) and pressing the `RESET` button (on the front) the USB port exposes a serial connection. This can be used to easily flash new firmware.

## Debug Console Output

The ESP32-S2 serial debug console is available on two test pads on the back of the board, in a cluster of three test pads to the left of the ESP32-S2 module. The `TX` signal is on the top-left pad with `RX` on the top-right pad.
