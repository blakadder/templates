Uses a TYWE2S daughter board, which makes it a Tuya device but ...
As of October 2020 the 4 packs of these have an updated firmware
that can't be flashed with Tuya-Convert v2. The same applies to the 2 pack. 
The PSK ID starts with 02. There is not a Tuya-Convert solution for these 
as of 10/2020.

The orginal template had GPIO1 as Led1i (56) and GPIO13 as Led2i (57) for
Template parameters. Those parameters result in the power button glowing red
color all the time. Using the non-inverse Led parameters Led1 (52) and Led2 (53)
result in the power button glowing blue when on and purple when off.

Firmware flashing has to be accomplished via the usual manual methods where one
has to first partially dismantle the device. The plastic shell is glued but it
does cleanly open with careful utility knifing. Unlike some plug devices the
plastic shell back plate is molded to the mains prongs (US version). There is a
dogleg in the neutral and hot prongs that is captured by the plastic back plate.
The PCB board must therefore be desoldered from the mains plug prongs for removing
the board to have access to its underside where the flashing wiring can be temporarily
soldered to the TYWE2S edge solder points. Grounding GPIO0 to put the TYWE2S into
flash mode is accomplished by grounding the TYWE2S test pad IO0. The TYWE2S board
is mounted to the main pcb board so that the side having the test pads faces
inside towards other components. Thus access to test pad IO0 is quite awkward.
