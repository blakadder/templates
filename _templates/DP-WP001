To have best results with this type of device I strongly recommend compiling a stripped down binary. There's an [unofficial binary](https://github.com/tasmota/install/tree/main/firmware/unofficial), compiled from current development release. Flash at your own risk.

After initial setup type the following into the Tasmota console window:
```console
Rule1 on TuyaReceived#data=55AA000000010101 do Power ON ENDON
Rule1 1
```
```console
SetOption59 1
SetOption66 1
PowerOnState 0
```
This device on Tasmota 8.1 does not report a full TuyaMCU message, but it spams 55AA000000010101 when motion is detected. It also powers on the tywe3s module (which probably the reason for the speed mentioned below).
```
"00:00:20 TYA: Send "55aa00000000ff"
"00:00:20 {"TuyaReceived":{"Data":"55AA000000010000","Cmnd":0,"CmndData":"00"}}"
```
With a static IP set and connected to Homeassistant, it takes 6 seconds to register motion. Recommend setting Homeassistant to activate on PIR connect. Waiting for the actual message takes longer.
