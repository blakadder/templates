Please read [TuyaMCU](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU) to understand the terminology and configuration process.

Flashed via serial by using TYWE3S pins. Might work with Tuya Convert.

Tuya Product ID: GQxEe5orh45cMgA61.0 

PCB code: KCL-M1801C_M 2018_11_12 V5.0

## Functions
`dpID 2` device mode: `0 = off / 1 = continuous / 2 = intermittent / 3 = timer`    
`dpID 4` set timer (180 min max) *not needed with Tasmota, there's a Timer function*    
`dpID 6` light control: `0 = off / 1 = rgb cycle / 2 = white / 3 = single color`   
`dpID 7` led dimmer    
`dpID 8` led color: `14 char value in hex` (can define only RGB and send HSV value as max: `RRGGBBffff6464`)    
`dpID 9` error notification: 70 = ok / 1 = error`  
`dpID 101` mist strength: `0 = low / 1 = high`   

> I found the built in buzzer very annoying and desoldered it for quieter operation!

## Configuration

After applying the template and configuring Wi-Fi and MQTT issue

```console
Backlog SetOption66 1; TuyaMCU 21,7; TuyaMCU 11,111; TuyaMCU 12,101; TuyaMCU 13,133; TuyaMCU 14,9; TuyaMCU 15,115; DimmerRange 1,255; SetOption59 1; SwitchMode 1
```

For diffuser control and status:
```console
Rule1 ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005020400010012 do Power1 0 ENDON ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005020400010113 do Power1 1 ENDON ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005020400010214 do Power1 1 ENDON ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005020400010315 do TuyaSend4 2,1 ENDON ON Power1#State=1 do TuyaSend4 2,1 ENDON ON Power1#State=0 do TuyaSend4 2,0 ENDON
```
For light control and status:
```console
Rule2 ON Power3#State=1 do backlog Tuyasend4 6,3; publish2 tele/diffuser/STATE {"Light":"ON","LightMode":"color"} ENDON ON Event#light_off do TuyaSend4 6,0 ENDON ON Event#rgb_cycle do TuyaSend4 6,1 ENDON ON Event#white do TuyaSend4 6,2 ENDON ON Event#color do TuyaSend4 6,3 ENDON ON Power3#State=0 do Backlog TuyaSend4 6,0; publish2 tele/diffuser/STATE {"Light":"OFF"} ENDON
```

```console
Rule3 ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005060400010319 do Power3 1 ENDON ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005060400010117 do Publish2 tele/diffuser/STATE {"Light":"ON","LightMode":"rgb_cycle"} ENDON ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005060400010016 do Power3 0 ENDON ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005060400010218 do Publish2 tele/diffuser/STATE {"Light":"ON","LightMode":"white"} ENDON
```
Don't forget to activate rules
```console
Backlog Rule1 1; Rule2 1; Rule3 1
```

Label webUI buttons:
```console
Backlog WebButton1 Power; WebButton2 Mist; WebButton3 Light; WebButton4 Error; WebButton5 -
```

### What you get
- fnid11 = Relay1 serves as device power status with the help of Rule1, dummy relay no control
- fnid12 = Relay2 is mist strength status and control
- fnid13 = Relay3 turns light on or off with Rule2 and Rule3
- fnid14 = Relay4 is used for error status (ON = error), no control
- find15 = Relay5 is a dummy relay so the dimmer doesn't control the other relays if we don't make one dimmer uses the last relay and would trigger errors
- fnid21 = Dimmer

Light mode and status are reported to mqtt topic `tele/diffuser/STATE` and command [`Event`](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands#event) is used to change light modes using [`TuyaSend4`](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands#tuyasend4) command. All this is defined in `Rule2`

Color can be changed using `TuyaSend3 8,RRGGBB64646464` (RR, GG and BB are hex value) only in color mode.

Dimming works using slider and `Dimmer` command.

## Home Assistant configuration
This implementation is suited to specific needs and does not incorporate all features of the device, mostly to avoid weird situations and wrong states being reported.

Fan is the diffuser. Light component is the device's RGB light.    
Binary sensor uses Relay4 to show when the diffuser is out of water.
