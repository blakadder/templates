This is a simple smart plug with the addition of a USB port. It is ESP8266 based featuring a On/OFF monenatary push button, 2 LEDs and 2 relays to switch the mains output. The USB port  is 'always on' and is not access this from the ESP module.
Opening up the device is easy. Two 2 screws are removed from the back panel then a small amount of gentle prying removed the cover exposing the components. Two more screws hold the PCB in place.

## Wireless Flashing

The device can be flashed via Tuya-Convert -- It's suggested this be attempted first, as a significantly less dangerous option.
It is suggested that this be attempted before ever connecting to an official app, but as of 28/10/2019 the official firmware updates delivered to the devices via the Genio app do not stop tuya-convert.


## Serial Flashing

The ESP module is mounted on a pcb with all of the required pins exposed.

I was able to flash by connecting GPIO0 to GND while connecting my Serial Adaptor and flashing as per any other ESP device.
