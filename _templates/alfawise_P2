# DISCONTINUED

To allow mqtt broker used, you need to provide some command at boot with this rule:
```console
Rule3 on wifi#connected do backlog serialsend5 55aa00000000ff; serialsend5 55aa0001000000; serialsend5 55aa0002000001; serialsend5 55aa0008000007; serialsend5 55aa000300010205; serialsend5 55aa000300010205; serialsend5 55aa000300010306 endon
```
Don't forget to activat it with `Rule3 1`

## Home Assistant configuration:

```yaml
fan:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Fan"
    state_topic: "stat/tasmota_9888E5/POWER"
    command_topic: "cmnd/tasmota_9888E5/POWER"
    speed_state_topic: "stat/tasmota_9888E5/speed"
    speed_command_topic: "cmnd/tasmota_9888E5/tuyasend4"
    availability_topic: "tele/tasmota_9888E5/LWT"
    payload_available: "Online"
    payload_not_available: "Offline"    
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    payload_low_speed: "4,0"
    payload_medium_speed: "4,1"
    payload_high_speed: "4,2"
    speeds:
      - low
      - medium
      - high
```
You have to use another rule so that it will report speed to mqtt:
```console
Rule1 on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005040400010014 do publish2 stat/%topic%/speed 4,0 endon on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005040400010115 do publish2 stat/%topic%/speed 4,1 endon on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005040400010216 do publish2 stat/%topic%/speed 4,2 endon
```
and activate it with `Rule1 1`

Don't forget to configure your device name to adapt to yours (tasmota_9888E5 in this case)

This air purifier, does not report PM info as it doesn't have the sensor in this version.

Light could be switched on by using `TuyaSend4 101,1` or even trough mqtt publishing info to:
- 0 light off
- 1 light middle
- 2 light full

It could only light in green even if it uses an RGB ring and it can turn the light on only when the fan is on.

Timer is set as light and fan speed using:

`tuyasend4 19,0/1/2`

- 0 off
- 1 2h
- 2 4h

Note also that dpId 20 seems to be timer remaining in minutes converted to hexa.

DpId 11 could be filter status/reset. No idea.
