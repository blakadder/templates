Recently, some smart plugs with the BR plug type started appearing on AliExpress

Usually, these products don't have a specific model and make, since they are mostly Tuya whitelables.
After searching alot, I've found [Nanxin NX-SM400](http://nanxin88.com/productView.aspx?view=887&id=109) which looks like this one.

## Flash Tasmota

Since this model working with the Smart Life app, we know it uses a Tuya chip.
To flash Tasmota, we need to us [tuya-convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert).
There's an [excellent tutorial (in pt-BR) by Douglas Baptista](https://forum.homeassistantbrasil.com.br/t/tuya-convert-flash/408) that you can use.

## Configuring Tasmota

To configure the smart plug on Tasmota, we have to know how the ESP pins are connected. I had to open mine to check the connections.
But you don't have to do the same. You can use this [template](https://templates.blakadder.com/nanxin_NX-SM400.html) that I've created.

Go to the device's IP address > `Configuration` > `Configure Other` > `Template`
```json
{"NAME":"NX-SM400","GPIO":[0,0,0,17,134,132,0,0,130,52,21,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
```
Just paste that line and check `Activate`

## Teardown

To create the template, I had to open the plug up.

If you want to do that, you can use a hot air gun on the bottom part and a flat head screwdriver to force it open.
It will probably damage the case a little bit and you will need to glue it shut.

The smart plug uses the `TYWE2S` Tuya chip, which is a `ESP8285`.

The power monitoring chip is the [BL0937](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/issues/737#issuecomment-377361861)
It's pins are connected like this:

BL0937 | ESP8285
--- | ---
Pin 6 (CF) | GPIO 4
Pin 7 (CF1)  |  GPIO 5
Pin 8 (SEL)  |  GPIO 12

The switch and LEDs are on another PCB. They are connected like this:

PCB | ESP8285
--- | ---
Red LED | GPIO 14 (Same as Relay)
Blue LED  |  GPIO 13
Switch  |  GPIO 3 (Rx)

At last, the Relay is connected to the `GPIO14` pin.
