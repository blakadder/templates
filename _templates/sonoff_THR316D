## Sensor Options

There are two sensor options when buying this device currently, one is the THS01 and the other being DS18B20 (Waterproof). 

To get the DS18B20 working when using the configure module, select the DS18x20 sensor for IO GPIO25, this will give you a temperature range from -55째C to +125째C.

To get the THS01 working when using the configure module, select the SI7021 sensor for IO GPIO25, this will give you a temperature range from -40째C to +85째C, humidity range of 0 to 100%RH.

If using the THS01 results in random "NULL" values. Try chaning the DhtDelay value to 'DhtDelay 500,40'. If successfull create a rule so that it stays persistent. 'Rule1 on system#init do DhtDelay 500,40 endon
Rule1 1'

## Sensor Wiring

Sensor are connected with a standard phone plug, search for 4P4C, RJ9, RJ10, or RJ22. You can use an [adapter](https://itead.cc/product/al010-2-5mm-audio-jack-to-rj11-adapter/ref/34/) to connect old sensors with an audio jack.
