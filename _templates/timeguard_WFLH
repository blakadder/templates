Wireless modules is TYWE2S.
Relay is on GPIO 12
Red LED (inverted) on GPIO 4
Green LED (inverted) on GPIO 5
Push button on GPIO 14

The device can be non-destructively opened for serial flashing using a tri-wing screwdriver.
3.3V and GND test points are available on the top side of the board.  Solder directly to the RX and TX pins on the TYWE2S.  GPIO0 is only available via a fiddly pad on the side of the module.

IÂ wasn't impressed by the build quality of this one, which is a shame as there are so few BC22 options.  Probably best to avoid using it with higher wattage lamps.
