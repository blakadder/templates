The Vacuum cleaner uses Dealdig App and therefor Tuya-convert is not possible. 
But the Wifi module is easy accessible and it's possible to remove it from the vacuum (for debugging reasons I installed a NodeMCU back on mine Vacuum and am still running stock firmware on the original chip).

After flashing Tasmota and install the wifi module back I started receiving `Serial` messages immediatly without assigning any pins in Tasmota
And it looks something like this `AA1C06FF00040500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000505E` and the messages are displayed every ~10seconds.

`AA1C06FF00` seems to be defaul, `04 05` represents the state of the vacuum, `50` is the battery % in Hex you can use something like this [Hex to Decimal](https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-decimal-converter) to convert it and the 2 last bits are the mod 256 checksum (the lower byte of the plain algebraic sum of all bytes) of the payload excluding the AA start byte and 1C function? byte.

The Vacuum can be used sending `SerialSend5` messages and the commmands are:
```haskell
Smart Cleaning: aa 03 02 22 02 26
Spot Cleaning: aa 03 02 22 01 25
Edge Cleaning: aa 03 02 22 00 24 
Stop: aa 03 02 26 00 28
Go Charge: aa 03 02 22 03 27
Move Front: aa 03 02 21 00 23 aa 03 02 21 04 27
Move Back: aa 03 02 21 03 26 aa 03 02 21 04 27
Turn Left: aa 03 02 21 01 24 aa 03 02 21 04 27
Turn Right: aa 03 02 21 02 25 aa 03 02 21 04 27
```

The Vacuum will enter _Hibernated mode_ after few minutes of not being in use displaying `AA1C06FF000405000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006472`. In this mode the battery level isn't updated correctly and to wake it up generally I have to press the option I want a couple of time until it wakes up (generaly around 3x times)

I have added the Vacuum to Home Assistant adding the commands as a scripts and then with [Vacuum Template](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/vacuum.template/) and [Lovelace Vacuum Card](https://github.com/denysdovhan/vacuum-card)
The [yaml Package](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/) can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Sthopeless/trvc/blob/master/vacuum_white.yaml

I have also created a picture without background of the vacuum to use with the lovelace integration:

The lovelace card:
```
compact_view: false
entity: vacuum.white_vacuum

show_name: true
show_status: true
show_toolbar: true
type: 'custom:vacuum-card'
