## Warning 

As of May 2022 these switches use a WB3S chip (BK7231T) and are no longer compatible.

The two blue LEDs are configured to toggle with the switches.
The additional red led behind the left button is configured as link indicator.

If you prefer the blue LEDs to be illuminated when power is turned OFF, i.e. when the room is dark, replace "Led1i"/"Led2i" by "Led1"/"Led2".
