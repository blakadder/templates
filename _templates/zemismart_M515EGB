`TuyaMCU 11,7` to move the relay to an uncontrollable dpId. WebUI toggle will have no effect.

Feedback is sent on dpId 3 while the position is controlled using dpId 2. To have both do the following:

`TuyaMCU 21,2`

```console
Rule1 ON Dimmer#State DO TuyaSend2 2,%value% ENDON
```

Enable the rule with `Rule1 1`

This setup might create some micromovements on reboot or same value dimmer commands!

### Home Assistant
