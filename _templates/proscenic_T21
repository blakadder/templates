While not supported with the existing hardware, the Wi-Fi module is contained on a separate board connected to the main PCB with a 4 pin PH2.54 connector. This board can be easily replaced with a [NodeMCU](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_9wkbgx) or any other 5V powered board or module and wired to the connector using Dupont cables. Once you open it its much easier than having to solder to a Wi-Fi module.

The top lid is held by 4 big plastic clips. Use a thin prying tool to slowly go around until all the 4 clips are loose enough to lif the lid. Unscrew and remove the protective plastic grid to get access to the Wi-Fi module which is screwed in on the front plate.

## Configuration
`MCU Product ID: {"p":"ngdn90sk1yqmk9ww","v":"1.0.2","m":0}`

After configuring Wi-Fi, MQTT and setting `Module 54`

Configure Tuya functions
```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 12,2; TuyaMCU 13,104; TuyaMCU 14,106; TuyaMCU 61,3; TuyaMCU 71,107; TuyaMCU 72,103; TuyaMCU 81,8; 
```

Finish configuring
```console
Backlog TuyaEnumList 1,10; TempRes 0;
```

- Power1 turns the air fryer on/off
- Power2 starts/pauses cooking program
- Power3 turn on/off keep warm option
- Power4 turn on/off delayed cooking start option
- Temperature sensor shows the internal temperature in ¬∞C
- TemperatureSet shows the set Cooking Temperature in ¬∞F
- Timer1 shows remaining cook time 
- TuyaEnum1 changes cookbook mode
- TuyaSend2 103,x to set target temperature
- TuyaSend2 6,x to set delayed cooking start timer
- TuyaSend2 7,x to set cooking time timer
- TuyaSend2 105,x to set keep warm timer

You can label webbuttons with emojis:
```console
Backlog WebButton1  üîå; WebButton2  ‚èØÔ∏è; WebButton3  üç≤; WebButton4  ‚è≥
```

## Extra
I removed the very annoying buzzer from the relay PCB and replaced it with a [DFPlayer MP3 player](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_9vm8Cn) that triggers on dpId reports with actual sound prompts. [Demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiAOQcs2Yww)
