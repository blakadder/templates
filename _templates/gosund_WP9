# An update about the warning below

In October, 2024 I bought [a GHome WP9 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JZ746QX).  It now uses a Tuya BK7231N chip in a Z2-N-V1.1 module.

I made [a post here in the OpenBK forums about flashing it with OpenBK](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/viewtopic.php?p=21258299#21258299).

I discovered this page after flashing it.  Testing with a plug-in circuit tester shows no problems with any of the unit's plugs.

# Warning! Do not buy this product! 

Was able to flash with 5 aligator clips (no soldering) RX/TX/GPIO0 route to PCB edge/pad with labels. 
Gnd/3.3 and be clipped from pins found between chip and regulator. Need triangle screw heads (torex can work).
NOTE however, this product was found to have a hot/neutral reverse issue on the middle and right power outlets. 
This is a design issue on the PCB itself so not a one-off. Unsafe product should not be purchased!
