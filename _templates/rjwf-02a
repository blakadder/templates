Confirmed that is not possible to use Tuya-Convert on the version of these devices with a 2020-5-13 or newer manufacture date.

Serial flashing is possible by soldering directly onto the [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) module. Follow [these directions](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/5377#issuecomment-514413512) as a bridge is required to flash the [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Pinouts/#tywe3s) in situ.

The template enables dimmer functionality using these required commands:

```console
TuyaMCU 21,2
```

Set dimmer range:
```console
DimmerRange 0,250
```
