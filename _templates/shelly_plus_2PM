Pin-Layout is on the image, credit goes to Kalin Dimitrov!

The pin ports on this board can handle dupont cables if done carefully, and will probably crumble shortly thereafter. 

The other surface connectors seem unusually weakly connected to the PCB, and you may destroy them while using them. Power monitoring hardware is included in the device, but not a part of this template.
