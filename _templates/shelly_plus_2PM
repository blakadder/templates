## Hardware Versions

There are currently 3 known hardware versions of the Shelly Plus 2PM. The pinout is incompatible between PCB version 0.1.5 and 0.1.9.

- PCB v0.1.5 with ESP32-U4WDH (Single core, 160MHz, 4MB embedded flash) Sold pre 2022
- PCB v0.1.9 with ESP32-U4WDH (Single core, 160MHz, 4MB embedded flash) Sold first half of 2022
- PCB v0.1.9 with ESP32-U4WDH (Dual core, 240MHz, 4MB embedded flash) Sold since 2022-09-20 (or earlier)

The PCB version can be found printed on the PCB.

4 units bought directly from Shelly 2022-09-20 where confirmed to be PCB v0.1.9 with 3 units being dual core ESP32-U4WDH, the last a single core. Both single core and dual core works with solo1 firmware

The internal temperature sensor on PCB v0.1.9 was desoldered and measured to be 10k fixed resistor to VCC in series with a 10k@25C NTC to ground. Beta constant is guessed to be 3350.

## Serial Pinout

![](/assets/device_images/shelly_plus_1_pinout.webp)
Pin-Layout on the image is for shelly plus 1PM, credit goes to Kalin Dimitrov.
The pin ports on this board can handle Dupont cables if done carefully, and will probably crumble shortly thereafter.
The other surface connectors seem unusually weakly connected to the PCB, and you may destroy them while using them.
