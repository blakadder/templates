The switched outlets are numbered 1-3 from top to bottom on the right side and USB outlets are 4.

10/02/2021: New firmware does block Tuya-Convert. The device can be flashed by serial using test points located on the rear of the board.  To access you need to fully 
remove the board from the plastic shell by removing the 3 screws and desoldering the outlet pins as they are encased in the rear plastic.  The esp8285 is fully exposed 
on the top with no can, but requires fine soldering skill/jig due to pitch and other proximity to components.
