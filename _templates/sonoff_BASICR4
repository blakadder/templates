## Support for MagicSwitch (tasmota32c3 >= 13.3.0.1)

To support the MagicSwitch feature as promoted by Sonoff, set GPIO5 as `MagicSwitch` with index `1` or use the following template:
```
{"NAME":"Sonoff Basic R4","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,224,10560,544,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1}
```

More details on the feature and configuration here: [PR#20247: Sonoff Basic R4 Magic switch](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/pull/20247)

MagicSwitch cabling:

Note: It can also be used with a single switch circuit by replacing the standard on/off switch by a single 2-way switch cabled as above.

## SECURITY WARNING

Analysis of the BasicR4 hardware shows the lack of a transformer on the power supply circuit. It is confirmed that the ESP GND is at a high potential (measured at 130V on 240V mains network).
*THIS DEVICE IS STRONGLY NOT RECOMMEND FOR HARDWARE HACKING* such as attaching external sensors as any wires would create a risk of high voltage shock. This include the 4 pins serial connector that should only be used for flashing while the device is not connected to mains.
Beside, Sonoff Basic are known for weak power supplies not suitable for such hacking.
