Some devices labelled [Moes MS-104](unsupported/moes_MS-104) are using a wi-fi chip unsupported by Tasmota.

The device use frequency detection circuits connected to GPIO12 and GPIO13 of the LM1 ESP8266 chip. At the moment you have to use a script to make it work with Tasmota. Script is not supported with precompiled binary (at least 6.6.0) so you have to compile your own fw. 

Below two scripts which do something like switchmode4, switchmode1 and switchmode0. The script for switchmode4 is created by @thxthx0, switchmode1 @caccia78 and @cHunter789, switchmode0 @antonio-fiol

Attention: I have found that the script (at least for switchmode 1) is somehow depended from sleep setting. Swichmode 1 script is tested and should be used with sleep 200 or 250.  

SwitchMode1

```lua
>D
sw1=0
sw2=0
cnt1=0
cnt2=0
pwr1=0
pwr2=0

>B
=>print "WiFi - 2 relay / 2 switch"
; The script is not tested with default sleep 50 so please use sleep 200
->sleep 200 
>F
; Always reset counters - consider only counts in last 100ms
cnt1=pc[1]
->Counter1 0

cnt2=pc[2]
->Counter2 0

if cnt1>5
then
; counter1 has increased in last 100ms - check with >2 for debounce
sw1=1
else
; no counter incres --> switch is off
sw1=0
endif

if cnt2>5
then
; counter2 has increased in last 100ms - check with >2 for debounce
sw2=1
else
; no counter increas --> switch is off
sw2=0
endif

; turn on the light if switches on
if sw1==1
and pwr1==0
then
=>Power1 1
pwr1=1
endif

if sw2==1
and pwr2==0
then
=>Power2 1
pwr2=1
endif

;turn off the light if switches off
if sw1==0
and pwr1==1
then
=>Power1 0
pwr1=0
endif

if sw2==0
and pwr2==1
then
=>Power2 0
pwr2=0
endif




```

SwitchMode4

```lua

if chg[cnt1]>0
then
; counter1 has changed, switch is on
sw1=1

sw1=0
endif

if chg[cnt2]>0
then
; counter2 has changed, switch is on
sw2=1
else

sw2=0
endif

; 100 ms timer

if sw1==0

and timer2<30
then
;=>print short press2

=>Power2 %toggle2%
endif

if sw2==0
then
timer2=0
endif

>S
; restart the device every sunday at 04:00
; to avoid possible issues when increasing counters and variables
