Set the TuyaMCU baudrate to 115200 bps:
```console
SetOption 97 1
```

The following mappings are required:
```console
TuyaMCU 21,2
```

Dimmer Range:
```console
DimmerRange 10,1000
```

Flashing:
The chip is easily accessible once the switch cover is removed. The cover is held by a few plastic clips and can be snapped off. It also has to be removed to secure the dimmer in the wall.

The ESPs serial connectors (RX/TX) as well as 3.3V and GND are exposed on the board. The GPIO0/Reset is not. I just soldered a wire onto it.
