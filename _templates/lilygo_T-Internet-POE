## v1.0/1.1 Board

For working Ethernet on board V1.0 and V1.1, `EthClockMode 3` is needed as included in the following template. This template also enables the card reader.

```json
{"NAME":"LilyGO T-Internet-POE","GPIO":[0,1,672,1,1,0,0,0,1,6720,736,704,1,0,5600,0,0,0,0,5568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1,"CMND":"EthType 0|EthClockMode 3|EthAddress 0"}
```

![v1.0 Board](/assets/device_images/lilygo_T-Internet-POE_v1.webp)

The advertised "Downloader Expansion Board" is not necessary for flashing. The six contacts near the product name on the backside are:

1. 3V3 (top most in the picture above near the ESP32)
2. GND
3. RST
4. IO0
5. RX
6. TX

The card reader uses these pins for communication:

| GPIO | Function |
|------|----------|
| 02 | MISO |
| 12 | MOSI |
| 13 | CS |
| 15 | SCLK |

So if you need the card reader in your project, three pins of the 2x8 header are already in use for SPI!
