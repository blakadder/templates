## ⚠️️Special Shelly Attention⚠️️

**Do not connect AC power and the serial connection at the same time** 
The GND connection of the Shelly has a 50% chance of being connected to the live AC wire. Connecting serial with your PC will fry your PC.

**Do not connect any additional sensors to serial pins.**
It can at least destroy your Shelly!

**Check the correct jumper position before connecting AC power to Shelly 1.**
If the jumper is set to 12V you will destroy your Shelly!

## Serial Connection
Shelly1 comes with a partially exposed programming/debug header which can be used to flash Tasmota on the device. A serial-to-USB adapter is needed as well as a reliable 3.3V source with at least 350 mA drive capability. The following diagram shows the device pinout.

## Flash mode
To be able to flash the Tasmota firmware you need to get into flash mode. Therefore connect a wire from GPIO0 to ground. For further information have a look at [Hardware Preparation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/#hardware-preparation#bringing-the-module-in-flash-mode).

## **⚠️️WARNING⚠️️**
Please note what version of the Shelly 1 you have (V1, V2 or V3). The V2 user guide is [incorrect](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/0d9bf8d9ddf1b29f33cb71ba5/images/cb16c7b5-5887-4ef2-b6c1-6e90ccaf648a.png?mc_cid=0a274764f3&mc_eid=05c10a130f). The mains connections are as shown in the image above for all versions of the switch. The labels on the V2 switches are [wrong](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/0d9bf8d9ddf1b29f33cb71ba5/images/cb16c7b5-5887-4ef2-b6c1-6e90ccaf648a.png?mc_cid=0a274764f3&mc_eid=05c10a130f)!
