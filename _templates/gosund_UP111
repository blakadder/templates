- 28-Nov-2022: box bought from [amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/3Ywh8jB). Would not flash via tuya-convert nor via serial. Not ESP8266, uses W701 chip - same as [this](https://groups.google.com/g/sonoffusers/c/OJhsmrOAmPQ)
- 10-Nov-2022: 2 x box of 4 bought from amazon.co.uk. Could not flash with tuya-convert. socket reboots on resending smartconfig packets. Polish imported with no manufacturing date on devices. 
- 22-Oct-2022: Received another lucky box of 4 from amazon.co.uk - the same reference to a Polish importer. This time NO manufacturing date on devices - flashed successfully with tuya-convert. No calibration needed.
- 21-Oct-2022: Box of 4 bought from amazon.co.uk, same as below - date of manufacture of 01/2021, reference to an importer in Poland, flashed OK. some devices booted into pairing mode, others required a long press of the button to get there.

It also has some importer details based in Poland - both on the box and devices. I guess, I was lucky with the purchase of an old and supported model. No calibration needed.
