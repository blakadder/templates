**Configuration for this device uses features not yet in official Tasmota (TuyaSend and TuyaReceived). Until they're merged compile your own binary [from this fork](https://github.com/blakadder/Sonoff-Tasmota/tree/door-sensor) or use [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/blakadder/Sonoff-Tasmota/tree/door-sensor) ([instructions for use](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Compiling-Tasmota-on-Gitpod))**

<!-- Please read [TuyaMCU](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/TuyaMCU) wiki entry to understand the terminology and configuration process. -->

There are a few different looking devices using the same PCB marked GD-HDFW05-v1.0 so this process should work on those. 

## Functions
`dpID 1` device power: 0 = off / 1 = on    
`dpID 11` led power: 0 = off / 1 = on    
`dpID 12` error notification: 0 = ok / 1 = error  
`dpID 13` countdown mode options: 0 = off / 1 = 1hr / 2 = 3hr *not needed with Tasmota*    
`dpID 14` countdown status: reports value of 0...360 minutes *not needed with Tasmota*    
`dpID 103` mist strength: 0 = low / 1 = high    
`dpID 108` led color: 14 char value in hex (can define only RGB and send HSV value as max: `RRGGBBffff6464`)    
`dpID 110` led mode: 0 = rgb_cycle / 1 = color / 2 = white    
`dpID 110` led dimmer **color and white modes only** *it is important to define 'DimmerRange 1,255'*

## Configuration

After applying the template and configuring Wi-Fi and MQTT issue

```lua
Backlog SetOption66 1; TuyaMCU 21,111; TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 12,11; TuyaMCU 13,103; TuyaMCU 14,12; TuyaMCU 15,110; DimmerRange 1,255; SetOption59 1
```
```lua
Rule1 on TuyaReceived#data=55AA000700056E040001007E do publish2 stat/GD-30W/EFFECT rgb_cycle endon on TuyaReceived#data=55AA000700056E040001017F do publish2 stat/GD-30W/EFFECT color endon on event#rgb_cycle do tuyasend4 110,0 endon on event#color do tuyasend4 110,1 endon on event#ON do backlog tuyasend4 110,1; tuyasend 11,1 endon on event#off do tuyasend1 11,0 endon on power3#state=1 do tuyasend4 103,1 endon on power3#state=0 do tuyasend4 103,0 endon
Rule1 1
```

*Optional rule used to prevent the device going into countdown mode (f.e. using on device controls) and complete MCU status update on restart*

```lua
Rule3 on TuyaReceived#data=55AA000700050D040001011E do tuyasend4 13,0 endon on TuyaReceived#data=55AA000700050D040001021F do tuyasend4 13,0 endon on mqtt#connected do serialsend5 55aa0001000000 endon
Rule3 1
```

### What you get
- Relay1 turns the diffuser on or off in stored mist strength mode, turns led on or off in stored mode and serves as device power status
- Relay2 turns light on or off and serves as light power status.
- Relay3 mist strength status and control using `Rule1`
- Relay4 is used for error status (ON = error), no control
- Relay5 is used for light mode status (0 = rgb_cycle, 1 = color), no control

LED mode status is reported to mqtt topic `stat/GD-30W/EFFECT` and command [`Event`](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Commands#event) is used to control some functions using [`TuyaSend4`](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Commands#tuyasend4) command. All this is defined in `Rule1`

Color can be changed using `TuyaSend3 108,RRGGBB64646464` but only in solid led mode

Dimming works using slider and `Dimmer` command but only when in color mode, in rgb_cycle there are no brightness controls.

Long press on device's power button initiates Tasmota's Wi-Fi config

## Home Assistant configuration
This implementation is suited to specific needs and does not incorporate all features of the device, mostly to avoid weird situations and wrong states being reported.

Fan is the diffuser. Oscillation switch is used to toggle between rgb_cycle (oscillation off) and color (oscillation on).
Light component is the device's RGB light but only when its in color mode, when in rgb_cycle mode it state in HA is off since you cannot control anything in rgb_cycle.
Binary sensor uses the dpId 12 to show when the diffuser is out of water.
