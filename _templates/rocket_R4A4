RocketController ASTRA R4A4 exist in 3 flavors depending on
- Power supply : 90-240VAC and/or 7-36VDC
- Type of input : AC, dry contact, GPIOs

The template has been read from the device as it comes pre-flashed with Tasmota and is listed here for reference or recovery

## Solution for inaccessible initial WebUI
If you have issues connecting to `ASTRA-xxxxxx` configuration access point, use the power-cycle reset feature of Tasmota to reset the firmware to defaults.
Then the standard `tasmota-xxxxxx` AP will appear and the wifi configuration can be done as per usual. 
**IMPORTANT:** After this recovery you will have to manually configure the template.

## DIP-Switches usages
- **RS mode**  : All switches to OFF (close to the numbers)
- **SPI mode** : All switches to ON
When in RS mode, the RJ is not connected anymore to the SPI GPIOs. It is intended to receive a RS Adaptation Module plugged between the internal UART2 and RS connectors to host an adaptation module
such as RS232 or RS485/Modbus. At the time of this writing, Rocketcontroller doesn't yet sale such
module as they are still in preparation.
When is SPI mode, the RJ is connected to the SPI GPIO and there **MUST NOT BE** any RS module installed
in the UART2/RS connectors.
