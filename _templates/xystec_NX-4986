The device needs to be flashed via serial - tuya convert does not work:
- open the hub carefully on the front and back << front only should be fine (power button), PCB slides out after that, maybe push USB ports gently (Rev2_2022_02_17)
- pull the board out of the case
- the pinouts are clearly accessible and visible - no soldering required

USB serial programmer | board
 --- | ---
RX | TX
TX | RX
GND | G
GND | IO0 
GND | RST *(required)* <<  not necessary for my "Rev2_2022_02_17"

Power the board over USB.

- plug the hub into usb to power it on
- plug the serial programmerr into the computer
- _(wait a few seconds,)_ remove the RST connection - *flashing mode* << not working for my "Rev2_2022_02_17" instead, for backup with Tasmotizer remove the IO0 connection worked, for erasing & flashing all 4 had to be connected
- flash the device as usual 
- apply the template
