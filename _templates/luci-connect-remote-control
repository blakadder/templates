1. Install latest Tasmota
2. Issue command
```console
TuyaMCU 12,102
```
3. Set up rule
```console
Rule1 on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005020400010012 do publish2 stat/flatbedfan/speed 2,0 endon on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005020400010113 do publish2 stat/flatbedfan/speed 2,1 endon on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00070005020400010214 do publish2 stat/flatbedfan/speed 2,2 endon
```
Enable rule with `Rule1 1`

4. Add the following to Home Assistant to your `fan` section

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
- platform: mqtt
  name: "Flat Bedroom Fan"
  state_topic: "stat/flatbedfan/POWER1"
  command_topic: "cmnd/flatbedfan/POWER1"
  payload_on: "ON"
  payload_off: "OFF"
  availability_topic: "tele/flatbedfan/LWT"
  payload_available: "Online"
  payload_not_available: "Offline"
  preset_mode_state_topic: "stat/flatbedfan/speed"
  preset_mode_value_template: >
    {%- if value == '2,0' %}low
    {%- elif value == '2,1' %}medium
    {%- elif value == '2,2' %}high
    {%- endif -%}
  preset_mode_command_topic: "cmnd/flatbedfan/TuyaSend4"
  preset_mode_command_template: >
    {%- if value == "low" %}2,0
    {%- elif value == "medium" %}2,1
    {%- elif value == "high" %}2,2
    {%- endif -%}
  qos: 0
  preset_modes:
    - "low"
    - "medium"
    - "high"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

5. Add the following to Home Assistant to your `light` section (if required):

```yaml
- platform: mqtt
  name: "Flat Bedroom Light"
  state_topic: "stat/flatbedfan/POWER2"
  command_topic: "cmnd/flatbedfan/POWER2"
  qos: 0
  payload_on: 'ON'
  payload_off: 'OFF'
  availability_topic: tele/flatbedfan/LWT
  payload_available: Online
  payload_not_available: Offline
```

6. Using the physical remote may not publish the state change. If so, the following rule will update the state every 30 seconds. 

```console
Rule2 ON System#Boot DO RuleTimer1 30 ENDON ON Rules#Timer=1 DO Backlog SerialSend5 55aa000200010305; RuleTimer1 30 ENDON
```
