## Module Config
Use Tasmota `9.1.0.2` with `Module 54`

This garage door opener includes a countdown timer. This timer sometimes interferes with the TuyaMCU heartbeat, so created some other rules to force a heartbeat ever 5 seconds. `TuyaMCU 81,7` uses new Timer available in `9.1.0.2` onward

## Tasmota Config

```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 81,7; TuyaMCU 2,101;
Switchmode1 4
Switchmode2 1
Rule1 on switch2#state=1 do publish2 stat/%topic%/reed_state Open endon on switch2#state=0 do publish2 stat/%topic%/reed_state Closed endon
Rule1 1
Rule2  ON system#boot DO ruletimer1 5 ENDON ON rules#timer=1 DO backlog serialsend5 55aa00000000ff; ruletimer1 5 ENDON
Rule2 1
Restart 1
```
