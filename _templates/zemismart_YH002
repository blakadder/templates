`TuyaMCU 11,7` to move the relay to an uncontrollable dpId. WebUI toggle will have no effect.

`TuyaMCU 21,2` maps the position command to dimmer, will not update position state on its own without the following rule.

Feedback is sent on dpId 3 while the position is controlled using dpId 2. To have regular dimmer updates use:

```console
Rule1 ON TuyaReceived#DpType2Id3 DO Dimmer %value% ENDON
```

Enable the rule with `Rule1 1`. The rule watches dimmer status dpId and forwards them to Dimmer command.

This setup might create some micromovements on reboot or certain value dimmer commands due to difference in how the MCU calculates position value!

## Functions
`dpID 1` motor control: `0 = open / 1 = stop / 2 = close / 3 = continue`    
`dpID 2` set position: `0 .. 100`    
`dpID 3` current position: `0 .. 100`   *report only    
`dpID 5` set motor direction: `0 = forward / 1 = back`      
`dpID 7` working state: `0 = opening / 1 = closing` *report only, only appears when using remote   
`dpID 10` error notification: `0x00 = ok` / ??? = error`  *report only
