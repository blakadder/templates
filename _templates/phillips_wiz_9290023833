## Disassembly

Plastic dome is glued, excessively, but still possible to remove with time and a razor. The LED board must be levered out, which is difficult. There's a small opening under the metal clip on the far end (away from pins) which can be used - however it's quite easy to accidently remove that clip when removing the board. To remove the main board, you can use a razor to remove the terminal on the bottom of the bulb. After that, you should be able to remove the main board from the bulb.

## Flashing

If you don't have a steady hand, removing the capacitor to the right of the chip is recommended while initially flashing. Otherwise, connect IO0 to ground when powering and continue as usual.
