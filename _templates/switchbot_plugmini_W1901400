## OTA Flashing
Can be flashed over-the-air with [SwitchbOTA Flasher](https://github.com/kendallgoto/switchbota).

## Serial Flashing
SwitchBot's Plug Mini is well-sealed and may require a dremel to cut the bottom piece open.

The Plug Mini has programming pads accessible from its side. Cutting the filled area in this photo provides access to the pads:

The daughterboard has clearly labeled pads to allow for programming. Short `P9` and `GND` to place the board into programming mode.
