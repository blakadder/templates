WR3 module is connected to the main PCB with a long cable that can be cut down and connected to an ESP8266.
A D1 Mini or an [ESP-M3](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_9zAd0m) without the pins soldered is preferable. You will also need some double tape to mount it in place

![WR3 Pinout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sthopeless/trvc/master/IMG_20200823_153621%20(2).jpg)

Once the ESP8266 is installed and flashed with Tasmota, select TuyaMCU module and activate publishing TuyaReceived to MQTT:
```console
Backlog Module 54; SetOption66 1
``` 

Activate also this rule to inform the TuyaMCU that the WiFi connection is ok (this eliminates the problem with wifi module rebooting all the time):
```console
Backlog Rule1 1; Rule1 on TuyaReceived#Cmnd=43 do SerialSend5 55aa002b0001042f endon
```

## Home Assistant
I've added the Vacuum to Home Assistant, the configuration can be downloaded here [https://github.com/Sthopeless/trvc/blob/master/vacuum_black.yaml](https://github.com/Sthopeless/trvc/blob/master/vacuum_black.yaml)

It is added to Home Assistant as a [Package](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/)

I am using the [Lovelace Vacuum Card](https://github.com/denysdovhan/vacuum-card)
