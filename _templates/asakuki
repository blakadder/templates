## Flashing

Flashing via Tuya-Convert (OTA) seems to be no longer possible due to the [PSK key issue](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/wiki/Collaboration-document-for-PSK-Identity-02).
Serial flashing can be done relatively easy without soldering. First, have a look at this [guide](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/). The device has a [TYWE3S module with a MCU](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU-Devices). The TYWE3S mostly takes care of Wi-Fi and software features while the MCU controls the actual hardware (buttons, lights, etc.). The MCU is interfaced to TYWE3S using the serial interface which connects to the Rx and Tx pins.
To flash Tasmota, just disassemble the unit (6 screws), remove the connectors and use some wire to connect TX, RX, GPIO0 and RST directly in the TYWE3S. As you can see in the image, there are headers for VCC and GND in the board. Make sure to ground GPIO0 during boot. To avoid interferences from the MCU, bridge RST to GND on the MCU too.

## Functions
`dpID 1` device power: `0` = off / `1` = on    
`dpID 11` light power: `0` = off / `1` = on    
`dpID 12` error notification: `0` = ok / `1` = error  
`dpID 13` countdown mode options: `0` = off / `1` = 1hr / `2` = 3hr *not needed in Tasmota, use Timer feature instead*    
`dpID 14` countdown status: reports value of 0...360 minutes *not needed with Tasmota, use Timer feature instead*    
`dpID 103` mist strength: `0` = low / `1` = high    
`dpID 108` light color: 14 char value in hex (set with `TuyaRGB 3`)    
`dpID 110` light mode: `0` = rgb_cycle / `1` = color / `2` = white    
`dpID 111` light dimmer

## Configuration

After applying the template and configuring Wi-Fi and MQTT, issue the following commands:

```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 12,11; TuyaMCU 21,111; TuyaMCU 24,108; TuyaMCU 61,103; TuyaMCU 62,110
```
This will:
- map tasmota relay1 with dpID 1 (diffuser on/off) 
- map tasmota relay2 with dpID 11 (light on/off) 
- map tasmota dimmer with dpID 111 (dimmer) 
- map tasmota enum1 with dpID 103 (mist strength) 
- map tasmota enum2 with dpID 110 (light mode) 

After a restart issue the rest of configurations:
```console
Backlog TuyaRGB 3; DimmerRange 0,255; TuyaEnumList 1,1; TuyaEnumList 2,2; SetOption17
```
This will:
- define the RGB Hex format used by the MCU
- declare the dimmer range from 0 to 255
- declare the enum1 and enum2 range
- show color in messages as a comma-separated decimal string

Now we will create a few rules. First rule is used to prevent the device going into countdown mode (f.e. using on device controls) and complete MCU status update on restart.
```console
Rule1 on tuyareceived#dptype4id13!=0 do tuyasend4 13,0 endon on scheme#data!=0 do backlog0 scheme 0; tuyaenum2 0 endon
```
Second rule sends two new MQTT topics: an error topic in case of the device is running out of water and a fanmode topic the mist strength  
```console
Rule2 on tuyareceived#dptype5id12 do publish stat/%topic%/error %value% endon on tuyareceived#dptype4id103==1 do publish stat/%topic%/fanmode high endon on tuyareceived#dptype4id103==0 do publish stat/%topic%/fanmode low endon
```
Third rule will shut down the light after turning on the difusser. 
```console
Rule3 on Power1#state=1 do Backlog delay 5; tuyaenum2 1; tuyasend1 11,0  endon on Power2#state=0 do tuyaenum2 1 endon
```

Finally enable the rules:
```console
rule0 1
```

Label webUI buttons and set friendly names for power outputs:
```console
Backlog WebButton1 Diffuser; WebButton2 Light; FriendlyName1 Diffuser Fan; FriendlyName2 Diffuser Light 
```

### What you get
- `Power1` turns the diffuser on or off in stored mist strength mode as device power status
- `Power2` controls the light as an RGB Light
- `TuyaEnum1` is for mist strength status and control: `0` for low / `1` for high
- `TuyaEnum2` is for light mode status and control: `0` for RGB cycle / `1` for solid color / `2` for solid white

Long press on device's power button initiates Tasmota's Wi-Fi config.

## Home Assistant configuration
Home Assistant sends a command_topic every time a color/brightness parameter of a light is changed. This makes the diffuser to start a RGB cycle, losing the color/brightness selected. To avoid this, I have created an automation to skip sending the power on command in case the light is already turned on.
A similar approach has been used to change the payload of the effect_command_topic.
