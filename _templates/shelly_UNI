## Serial Connection
Shelly UNI comes with a partially exposed programming/debug header which can be used to flash Tasmota on the device. A serial-to-USB adapter is needed as well as a reliable 3.3 V source with at least 350 mA drive capability. The following diagram shows the device pinout.

## Flash Mode
To be able to flash the Tasmota firmware you need to get into flash mode. Therefore connect a wire from GPIO0 to ground. For further information have a look at [Hardware Preparation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/#hardware-preparation#bringing-the-module-in-flash-mode).
