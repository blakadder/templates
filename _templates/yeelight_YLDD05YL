Applying the template will add two SetOptions to allow both PWM lights to be controlled: `SetOption37 128` and `SetOption92 1`

As it's highlighted in [Yeelight Pendant Light](yeelight_YLDL01YL)

* GPIO5  - Blue (PWM3)
* GPIO13 - Red (PWM1)
* GPIO14 - Green (PWM2)

Additional info about GPIOs - those are not covered by this template.
* GPIO4 - Controls Blue Led (on-board)
* GPIO16 - Controls Orange Led (on-board)

Please note, there is also a physical button on this device, however it has not been determined which GPIO it has assigned.

All pins necessary for flashing are on the module. ![Pinout](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/_media/pinouts/ESP32-SOLO-1.png)
