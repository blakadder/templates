## Warning

When ordering this board ask for relay board with test firmware, otherwise the ESP32 will be locked.

### Description
Dingtian relay boards are ESP32 based boards with 8, 16, 24 or 32 relays and inputs.
Relays are driven through x595 shift registers and inputs are read from x165 shift registers
Because the design is using some GPIO for both '595 and '165, those are not independent and could not be managed through the existing Shift595 driver

From version 3.6.10 and higher, PL is not used anymore and OE is used instead. This hardware (and software)change improves the relays control, causing the relays to stay of at power-on, keep there state during restart and being silent when on (https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/pull/18535).

This driver is not included in any official Tasmota build. You must [compile your own build](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Compile-your-build/) by adding the following line in your `user_config_override.h`:

```arduino
#define USE_DINGTIAN_RELAY
```

### Before hardware version 3.6.10
The driver define 5 News GPIOs (from [here](https://github.com/dtlzp/relay_dev_demo/tree/main/gpio_pinout)):

```

### Hardware version 3.6.10 and higher
The driver defines 5 GPIOs:

| GPIO_DINGTIAN_RCK | GPIO 15  | GPIO 15  | GPIO 15  | Latch of 595 outputs (but also Latch 165 inputs)      |
```

On the onboard header GPIO 4 and GPIO 5 are available (pin 7 and 8)

### Configuring CLK GPIO
The CLK GPIO supports index 1 to 4 to specify the number of shift registers:

- 1 : 8 relays/inputs boards
- 2 : 16 relays/inputs boards
- 3 : 24 relays/inputs boards (not really existing)
- 4 : 32 relays/inputs boards

Example for the 8 relay board:

### Mqtt Messages
Inputs state are reported through SENSOR message at teleperiod like for PCF8574/MCP230xx port extenders:

```shell
21:46:07.760 MQT: tele/dingtian1/SENSOR = {"Time":"2022-10-29T21:46:07+02:00","DINGTIAN":{"IN1":1,"IN2":1,"IN3":1,"IN4":1,"IN5":1,"IN6":1,"IN7":1,"IN8":1}} (retained)
```

And changes are reported to DINGTIAN_CHG topic:

```shell
21:46:50.665 MQT: stat/dingtian1/DINGTIAN_CHG = {"Time":"2022-10-29T21:46:50+02:00","DINGTIAN_CHG":{"IN1":0,"IN2":0,"IN3":0,"IN4":0,"IN5":0,"IN6":0,"IN7":0,"IN8":0}}
```
### Ethernet
To use ethernet JL1101 You must set 
GPIO12  ETH-Power
GPIO18  ETH-MDIO
GPIO23  ETH-MDC

and command: EthType 7  (JL1101)

### Note
The driver is limited to ESP32 as the Dingtian boards only use ESP32, however if needed the limit could be removed in order to use the same principle on a ESP8266 custom board.

See <https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/pull/17032> and <https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/pull/18535> for more info.
