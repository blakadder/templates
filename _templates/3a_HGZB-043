The RXD0 pin is used as one of the touch inputs, so you can't use the serial port for flashing (unless you cut a track). However tuya-convert works fine to flash it. After Tasmota is installed, a relay will click once per second as this in the default location for the status LED. You just need to connect quickly to the AP, and browse to `192.168.4.1/md`, and configure it as a generic module to stop the clicking. You can then go through the normal process, and restore this template.

Some numbers I found internally (taking off the cover) are 120K3S_WIFI_SV5 (for searching). I have uploaded a bunch of images here: https://github.com/sillyfrog/contact/issues/3

Finally, as there are a number of LED's, the new v9.1+ template correctly configures LedLink.
