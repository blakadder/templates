Devices on original firmware can be flashed with tuya-convert, however if your device has been updated then you will need to flash it manually. 

The device comes apart relatively easily, with 2 screws in the back and then use a couple of guitar picks to pop the outer cover off. There are 2 more screws holding in the PCB. Be careful removing the PCB as the USB port tends to catch on the plastic housing.
