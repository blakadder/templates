A small form factor ESP32-S2 dev board.

This board uses an [`ESP32-S2F-N4R2`](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s2_datasheet_en.pdf) chip with 4 MB of flash and 2 MB of PSRAM.

When the board is booted into debug by holding `BOOT` and pressing the `RESET` button the USB port exposes a serial connection. This can be used to easily flash new firmware.

## Device Notes

![Unexpected Maker TinyS2 Front](/assets/images/unexpectedmaker_tinys2_front.jpg "Unexpected Maker TinyS2 Front")

There are two versions of the TinyS2 with slightly different pinouts for the SPI pins.

## Peripherals

* [`WS2812B`](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf) Neopixel
    * On `GPIO1` with power on `GPIO2`.
    * _Provided template configures this as `WS2812` with `GPIO2` as `Output Hi` for power._
* 1S LiPo battery management subsystem with 2-pin JST-SH connector
    * Battery voltage on `GPIO3` and 5V/voltage detection on `GPIO21`
    * _Provided template configures `GPIO3` as `ADC Input 1` and does not configure `GPIO21`._

## GPIO Pin Mapping

The user pins labelled on the board are set up as `User` pins in the template.The pin numbers match the ESP's internal GPIO number assignments allowing relatively easy module configuration without having to translate pin.

The only exception are the pins labeled `TX` and `RX`, which are set up as `Serial TX/RX` in the template.
