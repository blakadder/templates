## Hardware

![MiBoxer FUT035W Dual White LED Controller (WIFI+2.4G) Board](/assets/images/miboxer_FUT035W_pcb.jpg)

The chip used on this board is a WBR3, and requires a transplant. It cannot be flashed. The daughterboard for the SoC is compatible with the ESP12-S. Other formats may be compatible, but may require jumper wires.

The TuyaMCU on board requires the following settings for an CCT strip.

```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,20; TuyaMCU 21,22; TuyaMCU 23,23; TuyaMCU 98,101; DimmerRange 0,1000
```
