## ⚠️️ Special Shelly Attention ⚠️️

**Do not connect AC power and the serial connection at the same time** 
The GND connection of the Shelly has a 50% chance of being connected to the live AC wire. Connecting serial with your PC will fry your PC.

**Do not connect any additional sensors to serial pins.**
It can at least destroy your Shelly!

**Check the correct jumper position before connecting AC power to Shelly 1.**
If the jumper is set to 12V you will destroy your Shelly!

## Serial Flashing
Shelly 1PM comes with a partially exposed programming/debug header which can be used to flash Tasmota on the device. A USB-to-UART adapter is needed as well as a reliable 3.3V with at least 350 mA drive capability. The following diagram shows the device pinout and power source voltage selection jumper.

## Calibration
Tasmota will disable serial logging after a restart as the communication between Tasmota and the Energy Monitoring chip is using the same serial interface. Make sure not to enable `SerialLog` as it will interfere with the Energy Monitoring functionality.

To calibrate the Energy monitoring feature connect a known load and execute the commands shown below. Assumed an AC voltage of 240V, a resistive load of 60W and a line frequency of 50Hz. With a load of 60W the current should be 60W / 240V = 0.25A.
```
FrequencySet 50.000
PowerSet 60.00
VoltageSet 240.0
CurrentSet 250.0
```
Pause a few seconds between executing the commands as the communication between Tasmota and the Energy Monitoring chip is a serial interface which can take over a second to complete.
