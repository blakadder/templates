I was able to tuya-convert this plug (with a printed date code on the product label of 06/2019). Tuya-Convert OTA flashing of this device should not require any button presses to enter flashing mode.

At first boot of an unconfigured device, the following sequence seems to execute leading up to a "flashable state":
1.  Red LED active for <5 seconds
1.  Blue LED active for ~60 seconds
1.  No LED active. Tuya-Convert should discover the devices at this time.  Subsequent boots of an unconfigured device on factory firmware seem to skip directly to this step.

There is both a red (GPIO5) and a blue (GPIO4)  LED on this device; both are inverted, but I can't seem to get the template to use them differently, so only red is used in the template.
