You have to replace the existing MWA6S with a (previously programmed) [ESP-02S](ESP-02S) or [ESP8685-WROOM-03](ESP8685-WROOM-03).

You need a size 2.0 triangle bit to open the case. The screws are under rubber stoppers, a fine screwdriver or needle pulls them out.
In addition, the underside is clipped in.

Successfully opened you can remove the circuit board with the MWA6S on a breakout board.

The MWA6S is held in place with a drop of glue: remove, then desolder the part.

Solder in the ESP-02S and fix it again with glue.
