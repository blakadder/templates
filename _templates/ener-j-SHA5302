Left Hand Socket is Button 1

There is a blue LED above the earth pin of each socket; these light when the corresponding socket is powered.

Neither of these templates controls power to the USB socket. I did not attempt to find a way to switch it off or on. It is always powered.

There is a green LED above the USB socket; this comes on if either 13A socket is powered.

To disable the Green LED always use this template instead :
```json
{""NAME"":""Ener-J 2-Gang "",""GPIO"":[17,0,0,0,0,21,18,0,22,0,0,0,0],""FLAG"":0,""BASE"":18}
```
