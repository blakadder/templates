## Serial Flashing

Please see the [Hardware Preparation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/#hardware-preparation) page for general instructions.

![Sonoff RE5V1C serial flash connections](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/631241/71563034-6cd10c80-2add-11ea-835a-da65c8009632.jpg)


```
GPIO1	ETX
GPIO2	IO2
GPIO3   ERX
GPIO4	RX
GPIO5	TX
```

Access the serial interface by soldering wiring to the labled solder pads as shown in the image above - (3V3, ERX, ETX, GND) are available on the relay mounted side of the PCB. Note: use the ERX and ETX pins, not the two marked RX/TX.

To place the board into flashing mode, depress the surface mounted button switch on the reverse side of the PCB while power is applied.
The used voltage regulator is a Low-Dropout Linear Regulator. Named as LM1117 which can deliever up to 800-mA.
