Similar to the Hyleton 317, this uses the Tuya TYWE3S module in place of the ESP8266, but using something such as [tuya-convert][1] can very easily convert the unit to Tasmota firmware. Blue LED on GPIO4, red LED on GPIO5, relay on GPIO12, button on GPIO13. Flash mode appears to be `1M QIO` on these units, but double-check during the tuya-convert process.

Be warned the Amazon UK link appears to have since gone dead (even opening it from my own order history), inexplicably.
