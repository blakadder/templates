I didn't find manufacturer but the models are marked as 802W to 808W there is just different top cover.

**Configuration for this device uses features not yet in official Tasmota release(TuyaSend and TuyaReceived). Use the [latest development branch](http://thehackbox.org/tasmota/) binary.**

Please read [TuyaMCU](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/TuyaMCU) wiki entry to understand the terminology and configuration process.

Flashed via Tuya convert. I was not succesfull with flashing via serial pins, I even desoldered the module from PCB. Also I found out there are GPIO 4 and 5 (probably others too) free so it could be connected to additional sensors.


## Functions
`dpID 1` device mode: `0 = off / 1 = continuous` Type1 

`dpID 2` error notification ?: 0 = ok / 1 = error` Type1

`dpID 3` set timer `0 = off / 1 = 1 hour / 2 = 3 hours / 3 = 6 hours` *not needed with Tasmota, there's a Timer function* Type4

`dpID 5` light switch: `0 = off / 1 = on ` Type1

`dpID 6` light mode: `0 = off / 1 = rgb cycle  3 = single color` Type4

`dpID 8` led color: `14 char value in hex` (can define only RGB and send HSV value as max: `RRGGBBffff6464`) Type4  

> I found the built in buzzer very loud so I dropped little hotglue to the center of it for quieter operation!

## Configuration

After applying the template and configuring Wi-Fi and MQTT issue

```console
Backlog SetOption66 1; TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 12,5; TuyaMCU 14,2; TuyaMCU 15,6; SetOption59 1  
```

For diffuser power on through button:
```console
Rule1 ON Power1#State=1 do TuyaSend4 3,0 ENDON
```

For light control and status:
```console
Rule2 ON Power2#State=1 do backlog publish2 tele/<TOPIC>/STATE {"Light":"ON","LightMode":"color"} ENDON ON Event#light_off do TuyaSend4 6,0 ENDON ON Event#rgb_cycle do TuyaSend4 6,1 ENDON ON Event#color do TuyaSend4 6,0 ENDON ON Power2#State=0 do Backlog publish2 tele/<TOPIC>/STATE {"Light":"OFF"} ENDON
```

```console
Rule3 ON Power5#State=1 do backlog Publish2 tele/<TOPIC>/STATE {"Light":"ON","LightMode":"rgb_cycle"} ENDON  ON Power5#State=0 do backlog Publish2 tele/<TOPIC>/STATE {"Light":"ON","LightMode":"color"} ENDON
```

Don't forget to activate rules
```console
Backlog Rule1 1; Rule2 1; Rule3 1
```

### What you get
- fnid11 = Relay1 serves as device power 
- fnid12 = Relay2 turns light on or off
- fnid14 = Relay4 should represent error status but I am not sure
- find15 = controls the type of light

Light mode and status are reported to mqtt topic `tele/<TOPIC>/STATE` and command [`Event`](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/Commands#event) is used to change light modes using [`TuyaSend4`](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/Commands#tuyasend4) command. All this is defined in `Rule2`

Color can be changed using `TuyaSend3 8,RRGGBB64646464` (RR, GG and BB are hex value) only in color mode.

Dimming is controlled by HSV values, HomeAssistant can handle this natively.

## Home Assistant configuration
This implementation is suited to specific needs and does not incorporate all features of the device, mostly to avoid weird situations and wrong states being reported.
