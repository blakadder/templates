## Flashing 

Semi-transparent semi-sphere cover pops off quite easily with a screw driver. One then needs to solder wires onto TX, RX, VCC, GND, Reset and GPIO0. Power the device from an FTDI breakout module. Reset the device while shorting GPIO0 to ground. Now the device is in flash mode and https://tasmota.github.io/install/ can be used.
