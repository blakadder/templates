## Flashing 
1. you must remove the 4 rivets holding the 2 sides together
2. remove the 2 cable connectors from the PCB, remove the button and 2 light guides, then lift and flip the pcb
3. on the backside locate the ESP 8285 and using the pinout below solder 4 wires to 3.3V, GND, TX and RX. Tip: use GND form the power button, easier to access

:warning: the pins are VERY small, itâ€™s a difficult job as 3.3V, TX, RX are next to each other
