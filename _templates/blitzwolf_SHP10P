You need Tasmota 8.3.1.3+ to support the new power metering chip.

This template is only for SHP10 **WITH POWER METERING**. [Non-power metering version](blitzwolf_SHP10) looks identical and is sold under same model number. Check the barcode on the box: POA6204581 is the non-power monitoring version, while POA6204582 is the power monitoring version.
