Pinouts are shown on the ESP32 Board. It's VCC, GNC, RX, TX, ESP32C3 Rev.3

On some devices the serial connection is disabled and won't work. One can
then use the ESP32 built in USB-to-serial adapter by connecting a USB cable
directly to the board. The pin opposite of `VCC` is `USB data +` (green wire),
the pin opposite of `GND` is `USB data -` (white wire). Do *not* connect the
other two (5V and GND) wires of the USB cable. Those have the wrong voltage
and will brick your device! Connect `GND` and `VCC` on the board to a
suitable 3V3 power supply instead.
