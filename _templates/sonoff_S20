Sonoff S20 comes in 4 plug type variants. Flashing process will be the same for each type.
## Serial Connection

Please see the [Hardware Preparation](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/Hardware-Preparation) page for general instructions.

The picture shows how to program the S20 Smart Socket powered by the serial-to-USB converter.  With newer US sockets, either use a right-angle header, or remove the header after flashing.  Otherwise,the pushbutton may rub against a pin and get stuck.

Be sure it is **NOT** plugged in mains!

Remove the "hidden" screw.

> (optional) Remove the board from the plastic shell to have better access to serial pins.
There are 2 screws at the red and blue wire. Be careful not to damage the soldered connection!

Connected?
Hold the little button pressed while connecting the serial-to-USB adapter to your computer. After about 2 seconds let go of the button. It is now in flashing mode and ready to be flashed with Tasmota.
