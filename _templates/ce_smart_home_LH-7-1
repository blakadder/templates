### Connection
This 6-outlet outdoor garden power stake is controlled by a standard ESP-12 chip connected to a single relay, meaning that all 6 outlets are on or off simultaneously. It also has a mains switch, a manual relay trigger button, and an LED indicator.

|Programmer  | Power Stake|
|-----------:|:-----------|
|        3V3 | VCC        |
|         TX | RX         |
|         RX | TX         |
|        GND | GND        |

The button is not connected to `D0`, so you will need to shunt `D0`/`GPIO0` to GND to enable programming mode. You may need to briefly shunt RESET to GND in order to initiate connections to the device.
