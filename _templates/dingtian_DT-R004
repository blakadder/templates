## Warning
When ordering this board ask for relay board with test firmware, otherwise the ESP32 will be locked.

Relay 1 is connected to GPIO 16 which is used for PSRAM in Tasmota, to prevent a pulse on Relay 1 upon boot use the tasmota32-nopsram firmware. (https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/discussions/21266)

### Description
Dingtian relay boards are ESP32 based boards with 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 or 32 relays and inputs.

At the 2 and 4 relay boards the relays and inputs are directly connected to the gpio's of the ESP32.

Example for the 4 relay board:

### Mqtt Messages
Inputs state are reported through SENSOR message at teleperiod:

```shell
MQT: tele/dingtian1/SENSOR = "{"Time":"2024-04-26T09:17:15","Switch1":"ON","Switch2":"ON","Switch3":"ON","Switch4":"ON"}"
```

Input changes are only reported when using switchmode 15 or 16:

```shell
 MQT: stat/dingtian1/SENSOR = {"Time":"2024-04-26T09:24:02","Switch1":"OFF","Switch2":"ON","Switch3":"OFF","Switch4":"OFF"} (retained)
```

When using switchmode 0, Input changes are not reported, but the output changes are reported:

```shell
 MQT: stat/dingtian1/RESULT = {"POWER1":"ON"}
```

### Note

For using Modbus on the RS485 port (if ordered with this option) have a look at https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Modbus-Bridge/
