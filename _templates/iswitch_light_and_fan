After configuring your WiFi details and configuring the template, use the console to issue the following commands:

'Backlog TuyaMCU 12,9; TuyaMCU 11,1'

- TuyaMCU 12,9 configures the light switch
- TuyaMCU 11,1 configures the fan switch

As the fan switch takes enums, we need rules to handle the fan switch when it's used from the switch (Rule 1), and a rule to set the fan speed and on/off when changed via MQTT (Rule 2)

Next add the following rules:

Rule: Publish speed to MQTT when using the physical switch.

```console
Rule1 
	on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA03070005030400010016 DO Publish stat/%topic%/SPEED 3 endon 
	on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA03070005030400010117 DO Publish stat/%topic%/SPEED 2 endon 
	on TuyaReceived#Data=55AA03070005030400010218 DO Publish stat/%topic%/SPEED 1 endon
```
`Rule1 ON`

Set speed when commands arrive from OpenHAB via MQTT.

>  0 = Off, 1 = Slow, 2 = Medium, 3 = Fast, 4 = On (last speed)

```console
Rule2
	on Event#0 DO Power1 0 endon  
	on Event#1 DO Backlog Power1 1; TuyaSend4 3,2 endon 
	on Event#2 DO Backlog Power1 1; TuyaSend4 3,1 endon 
	on Event#3 DO Backlog Power1 1; TuyaSend4 3,0 endon
	on Event#4 DO Power1 1 endon
```
`Rule2 ON`
