Use the _mini USB_ port to flash the device.

Terminals marked DA1 and DA2 are DAC GPIO's 25 and 26 which can be controlled using [Berry gpio.dac_voltage](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Berry/#support-for-dac-gpios-on-esp32-and-esp32-s2).

Digital inputs are optocoupler isolated. RF433 receiver and transmitter come only in some bundles. 

Button marked S2 is a bit fussy when trying to use multi-press, adjust if needed using `ButtonDebounce`.
