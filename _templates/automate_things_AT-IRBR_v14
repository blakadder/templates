With over 10 Meters range, the IR Bridge allows you to control almost any infrared device and is compatible with
[Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Tasmota-IR/) and [ESPhome](https://esphome.io/components/remote_transmitter.html).
If you are feeling ambitious then you can even use the [IRremoteESP8266](https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266)
Library with Arduino!

With the 38kHz IR Receiver you can configure Tasmota to relay IR signals via WiFi and repeat IR signals in a different room using a 2nd IR
Bridge.

The device can be easily integrated into home automation solutions such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).
You can even place the device behind your TV and it should still be able to control it.

The best part is that as *you* decide what Firmware to install on it there is no need for another Mobile App or a Cloud Subscription.

**Things you will need to provide:**
  - 5V/1A Power Supply via Micro USB.

**Wholesale Orders or Custom Builds**    
Please [contact Automate Things UK](https://automate-things.uk/) if you need to order a quantity of units, or need something custom.
