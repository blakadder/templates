To flash this bulb, I used tuya-convert and then upgraded to the full image.  

Note I used tuya-convert-os (https://github.com/qtoggle/tuya-convert-os).  If you do this, log into the console of your rpi and do the convert from the command line (sudo su; cd /root;) the web gui did not allow me to chose an image which left the bulbs half flashed.  I had to re-flash them to finish the tasmota install."
