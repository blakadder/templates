Attention: current version of the device might require installing your own custom build of Tasmota. Shutter Calibration requires vendor's Cloud-App.
Reason: "ShutterMode" is not included in the preinstalled Tasmota build. 

Also, only restricted set of Tasmota features is supported. Reason: The device uses the dual controller (Tuya) design as described on [Tuya Covers in Tasmota](blakadder.com/tuya-covers)
