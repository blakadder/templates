This device requires a transplant of the microcontroller. The original microcontroller comes with efuse enabled, and cannot be reprogrammed. You will need a rework station to heat the chip and remove it carefully without melting the plastic frame.

This device works on split-phase 240V only. It does not require a neutral per-se. Consult with an electrician before attempting to wire this device.

The device periodically resets the onboard microcontroller every 3 seconds by pulling down the CHIP_PU pin as a protection. This protection can be turned off by adding a 10 kiloohm resistance between the `+` and the `WDENn` pads next to the microcontroller.

The device contains the following sensors. All of them are discovered by the i2c bus.

 1. HDC2010 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
 2. MAX11612 Analog to Digital Converter
 3. AT42QT1070 Touch Sensor
 4. IS31FL3731 LED Matrix Controller

To enable the devices, make sure to compile Tasmota with the following flags.

```
#ifndef USE_I2C
#define USE_I2C
#endif

#ifndef USE_HDC2010
#define USE_HDC2010
#endif

#ifndef USE_MAX11612
#define USE_MAX11612
#endif

#ifndef USE_AT42QT1070
#define USE_AT42QT1070
#endif

#ifndef USE_THERMOSTAT
#define USE_THERMOSTAT
#endif

#ifdef THERMOSTAT_SENSOR_NAME
#undef THERMOSTAT_SENSOR_NAME
#endif
#ifndef THERMOSTAT_SENSOR_NAME
#define THERMOSTAT_SENSOR_NAME "HDC2010"
#endif

#ifndef USE_PI_AUTOTUNING
#define USE_PI_AUTOTUNING
#endif
```

Once the device is reassembled, running and configured, the thermostat can be enabled by adding a rule. Make sure to review the default settings and adjust them accordingly. Consult the Thermostat documentation of Tasmota for more details.

```
Rule1 on system#boot do Backlog THERMOSTATMODESET 1; CONTROLLERMODESET 0; ClimateModeSet 0; TEMPTARGETSET 23; SENSORINPUTSET 1; TIMEMINACTIONSET 1; TIMEMAXACTIONSET 5; TIMEALLOWRAMPUPSET 10; TIMERAMPUPCYCLESET 15 TELEPERIOD 30 endon
Rule1 1
```
