## Warning! Since 2022-03-19 ships with an incompatible Tuya CB3S. If the box says "HUBIR01HA Series 2" its likley its the incompatible chip.

It is possible to replace the incompatible CB3S chip with a [ESP-12 S/E/F](https://templates.blakadder.com/ESP-12.html). If you do, depending on your chip you may need to pull GPIO15 down to ground with a 10k resistor for the ESP device to boot

## Old hardware instructions

You will need to flash the tasmota-ir.bin firmware to this deivce.
