Had to use AP config mode to provision the wifi first, then used standard tuya-convert process.

To use tuya-convert with AP mode:

1. put the device in AP pairing mode
2. connect with a linux computer
3.  fake the config packet:
```
echo 000055aa00000000000000010000003e7b2273736964223a227674727573742d666c617368222c22706173737764223a22222c22746f6b656e223a223030303030303030227d726cfc610000aa55 | xxd -ps -r | socat - UDP-DATAGRAM:255.255.255.255:6669,broadcast
```
4. run tuya-convert and press enter, it is already paired
5. flash it!

After flashing, I used the following MCU config:

```
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,2; TuyaMCU 12,101; TuyaMCU 13,103;
```

This maps start/stop to `POWER1`, go home to `POWER2`, and find to `POWER3`.

Manual control can be performed on dpId 3, enum 0-3, ie: `tuyasend4 3,{0-3}`

Operating mode is on dpId 5, enum 0-4.

Fan speed is on dpId 102, enum 0-3.

And added rules for easy access to feedback data:
```
rule1 on tuyareceived#dptype4id5 do publish2 stat/%topic%/mode %value% endon on tuyareceived#dptype4id15 do publish2 stat/%topic%/status %value% endon on tuyareceived#dptype4id102 do publish2 stat/%topic%/speed %value% endon on tuyareceived#dptype2id104 do publish2 stat/%topic%/battery %value% endon on tuyareceived#dptype4id106 do publish2 stat/%topic%/error %value% endon
```

This will expose operating mode, operating status, fan speed, battery level, and error code under `stat/devicename/{mode,status,speed,battery,error}`.

I also exposed whether it is charging or not with:
```
rule2 on tuyareceived#dptype4id15==3 do publish2 stat/%topic%/charging 1 break on tuyareceived#dptype4id15==4 do publish2 stat/%topic%/charging 1 break on tuyareceived#dptype4id15 do publish2 stat/%topic%/charging 0 endon
```

You can then read charging state on `stat/devicename/charging`.
