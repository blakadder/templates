This is only a proof of concept!!! Installing Tasmota does not result in a functioning soldering iron. There is no built in control of the heating element. Drivers for the SparkFun LIS2DH12 accelerometer sensor are missing. Original firmware and source can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/Eddddddddy/SolderingPen_FW)

***DANGER***
Heating element is controlled with `Power1`. This can be dangerous because the soldering tip can overheat very very quickly (10 seconds when powered with 20V).

## Pinout

- GPIO33: tip temperature sensor
- GPIO26: input voltage sensor
- GPIO15: buzzer
- GPIO4: middle button
- GPIO2: `+` button
- GPIO14: `-` button
- GPIO25: MOSFET PWM control for heater
- GPIO21: I2C SDA
- GPIO22: I2C SCL
