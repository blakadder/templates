Disable buzzer with command `SetOption67 0`

The button is connected to GPIO0

If you want the light and fan to turn on when you power on your IFan03, use `PowerOnState 1`

If you want only the light to turn on when you power up, use `PowerOnState 0` and then `rule1 on power1#boot do backlog fanspeed 0; power1 1 endon`

## Serial Flashing

Use the labelled pins on top to flash.
