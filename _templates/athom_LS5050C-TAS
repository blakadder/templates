This device supports 3 PWM channels, but can easily be modified to support 4, to control RGBW LEDs:
The back of the case is held in place by clips, and prises open.
In order to enable the fourth channel, you need to add three components: '0805' size surface-mount resistors of values 1k and 10k, and a 'SOT-23' size surface-mount N-channel MOSFET type AO3400 (marked A09T), in the positions shown.  You will also want to replace the output cable with one with 5 conductors.

To enable the extra channel (which is connected to GPIO13) in Tasmota, you can use the following template:

> '{"NAME":"LS5050C-TAS","GPIO":[32,0,0,0,416,0,0,0,417,419,418,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}'
(Note: This also swaps the order of the first two channels so the colours align with the 'R' 'G' 'B' and 'W' markings on the PCB.)
