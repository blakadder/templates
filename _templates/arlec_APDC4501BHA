Appears to be exactly the same device as [Arlec AWDC001HA](arlec_AWDC001HA.html) except on a pedestal. These fans move an amazing volume of air.

The ESP8266 is located underneath the dial/switch on the top of the fan. You need to take the covers and blades off to access it.
## Disassembly
- Remove the dial
- Remove 3 screws on the front of the motor
- Pull the plastic cover off the motor
- Detach the wires
- Inside the plastic motor cover you can remove the screws and remove the cover form the top
- Undo the nut to remove the board from the plastic cover.

## Flashing
You need to solder the correct pins directly on the ESP, 3.3v, U0TX, U0RX and GND.
The pins on the board labeled 5V, GND, RX and TX should not be used to flash. RX and TX are attached to U1 not the required U0
