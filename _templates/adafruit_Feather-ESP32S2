A Feather form factor ESP32-S2 dev board with 1S LiPo battery monitoring and an optional on-board BME280 sensor.

This board uses an [`ESP32-S2-MINI-1-N4R2`](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s2-mini-1_esp32-s2-mini-1u_datasheet_en.pdf) module with 4MB of flash and 2 MB PSRAM.

When the board is booted into debug by holding `BOOT` and pressing the `RESET` button the USB-Serial chip on the USB port exposes a serial connection. This can be used to easily flash new firmware.

## Peripherals

* [`WS2812B`](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf) Neopixel
    * On `GPIO33` _(configured as `WS2812`)_ with power on `GPIO21` _(configured as `Output Hi`)_.
* [STEMMA-QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt) JST-SH I2C bus connector
    * Both ports share the same bus, on `GPIO3` (SCL) and `GPIO4` (SDA) _(configured as `I2C 1`)_ and `GPIO7` for power _(configured as `Output Hi`)_. These ports are on the same bus as the `SCL` and `SDA` pins labelled on the board.
    * _Some early revisions of this board had their I2C power control logic reversed, requiring `GPIO7` to be pulled low instead of high to provide power and pull-ups to the I2C bus. If I2C isn't working, try changing `GPIO7` to `Output Low`_
* [`BME280`](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/783/BST-BME280-DS002-1509607.pdf) temp/humidity/pressure sensor
    * On I2C bus, supported by Tasmota
* 1S LiPo battery management subsystem with 2-pin JST-PH connector
    * Includes [`LC709203`](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/308/LC709203F_D-1810548.pdf) battery monitor IC on I2C bus, _not currently supported by Tasmota_.
