Found listed also as MC400A under various brand names.

Please read [TuyaMCU](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU) article to understand the terminology and configuration process.

This is a Tuya/Smart Life battery powered contact (door or window) sensor. Runs on two AAA batteries (not supplied with the device).

Identified with MCU Product ID: `{"p":"hx5ztlztij4yxxvg","v":"1.0.0"}` which is also printed on the TYWE3S module.

## Flashing
To have best results with this type of device I strongly recommend compiling a stripped down binary. There's an [unofficial binary](https://github.com/tasmota/binaries), compiled from current development release. Flash at your own risk.

Example <a href="/assets/tuya_sensor_user_config.txt" target="_blank" >user_config_override</a> defines (for Tasmota 8.2+).

### Serial
Easily disassembled by removing the back plate, unscrewing the screw in the battery holder and prying away the plastic using the bottom slot.

The PCB has only the **20191022** marking on it and a prominent TYWE3S module with the product ID printed. There are broken out pins for 3v3, RX, TX and GND but to be able to solder a pin header in them you need to desolder the battery holder which is probably not worth the trouble since all the pins are accessible on the TYWE3S.

#### MCU details 

STC8F1K08S2 MCU, situated on the left of the broken out pins, powers on the Tuya module on reed actuation or on "Reset" bottom button press for a short amount of time sufficient to send opening or closing message.

| MCU PIN | Connection | explanation |
|---|---|--- |
| P5.4 | D2 | LED
| P5.5 | SC9JF | controls ESP power via EN pin on voltage regulator  |
| P3.3 | R12 | RESET button
| P3.2 | S1 | reed switch |
| P3.1 | RX | ESP and broken out pin |
| P3.0 | TX | ESP and broken out pin |

Due to this design it is somewhat difficult to tuya-convert or even configure the device compared to non-battery powered ones. I flashed the device over serial powering the TYWE3S from the USB-to-serial adapter.

## Configuration

_If you're using battery power you need to prevent the device from going to sleep by actuating the reed switch constantly (approximately every 5 seconds) during the configuration or use the serial message._

You can use 
```console
SerialSend5 55AA000200010002
``` 
shortly after boot to put the device into wi-fi search mode (rapidly blinking red LED) which will keep it powered on for around 60 seconds.

Change device to a TuyaMCU module (or apply the provided template, result is the same)
```console
Module 54
```

Disable multipress button options to prevent a device reset or Wi-Fi AP config mode, disable Power Cycle recovery, turn on TuyaReceived publish to MQTT and set switchmode to follow instead of toggle
```console
Backlog SetOption1 1; SetOption65 1; SetOption66 1; SwitchMode 1
```

Switch the device to battery powered sensor mode (fnId 51):
```console
TuyaMCU 51,21
```

Check with `TuyaMCU` for the following configuration:
```json
 {"TuyaMCU":[{"fnId":11,"dpId":1},{"fnId":51,"dpId":21}]}
```

## Functions
`dpID 1` reed switch: closed = off / open = on    
`dpID 3` battery power: 0 = low / 1 = medium / 2 = high

The button labelled reset can wake up the device with a short press or put it into Wi-Fi config mode on long press.

dpID 1 is assigned to Relay1 by default. 

There is no function in Tasmota for enum dpID's currently so we will use a rule to report battery status (high, medium or low) to a custom topic (change it to any other topic suitable for you)

```console
Rule1 ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00050005030400010213 DO publish2 stat/%topic%/BATT high ENDON ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00050005030400010114 DO publish2 stat/%topic%/BATT medium ENDON ON TuyaReceived#Data=55AA00050005030400010015 DO publish2 stat/%topic%/BATT low ENDON
```

Don't forget to turn on the rule: `Rule1 1`

And there it is, relatively small battery and Tasmota powered contact sensor.

## Final Notes
There is a significant delay (~4s on my network with the latest stripped down binary and a static IP) between reed actuation and first MQTT message so I don't recommmend this in critical spots where a fast response is required.

If the batteries are too weak, sensor might be stuck in a bootloop or spawn an ESP-XXXXX AP. The bootloop can reset Tasmota to "factory defaults". You can disable bootloop protection with `SetOption36 0` but that might also put the sensor in a permanent bootloop until the battery dies.
