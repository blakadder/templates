## Warning

As of November 2021 this product can ship with a different chip that can not be replaced with a ESP-12 chip.

As of July 2020 this device comes with a Tuya WB3S module which cannot be flashed with Tasmota.     
That module is pin compatible with ESP-12 and can ordered via Ebay. Replace the module with a hot air gun. All LEDs are usable R,G,B,CW,WW and you can dimm it.

To use the build in IR Receiver connected to GPIO00 as IRrecv (if this cannot be selected under configuration use Tasmota-Sensors.bin) add the following rule via Command Line. 

```console
Rule1 ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F740BF do power off ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7C03F do power on ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F700FF do dimmer + ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7807F do dimmer - ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F720DF do color2 ff0000 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7A05F do color2 00ff00 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7609F do color2 0000ff ENDON

Rule3 ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F728D7 do color2 fcfc05 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7A857 do color2 2d7c93 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F76897 do color2 fc5582 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7E01F do color2 ffffff ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7E817 do scheme 2 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7C837 do scheme 3 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7F00F do scheme 4 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00F7D02F do Power 3 ENDON
```

Don't forget to enable the rule with 'Rule1 1'!

The IR commands don't look complete but support ON/OFF and RGBW Color changes.
