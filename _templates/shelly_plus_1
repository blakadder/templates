Use Tasmota v9.5.0.9+. Older versions do not work.

Some versions (possibly older or non-UL ones) have a single-core
MCU. These must be flashed with ESP32-SOLO1
<code>tasmota32solo1...</code></a> binaries.

Known versions (printed on the board):

* v0.2.1 (UL version): Dual-core MCU

Caution: All these pins are live at mains voltage!

GPIOs are as follows:

- LED output is on GPIO 0 (not really visible through the case)
- The switch input is on GPIO 4
- GPIO 19 is accessible on the programming header
- The small button on the back is input on GPIO 25 (needs pull up enabled)
- The relay output is on GPIO 26
- GPIO 32 is an NTC thermistor with a ?10k bridge resistor.  Use "adcparam1 2, 10000, 10000, 3350" to get a sensible value (calibration needed!)
- GPIO 33 appears to sense the supply voltage for driving the relay.  You can use this to determine whether the device is powered from the mains or the programming header.

The only information on the NTC thermistor I could find was at https://www.esphome-devices.com/devices/Shelly-Plus-1
