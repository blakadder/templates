This is a Tuya natural gas (CH4) sensor with an LCD display and alarm function. It has a TYWE3S module and an Eastsoft HR8P506FHLQ MCU.

Identified with MCU Product ID: `{"p":"sclatjo1jqscmwwe","v":"1.0.0","m":0}`. 

## Functions
`dpID 1` gas: 0 = detected gas / 1 = no gas     
`dpID 2` gas amount = displayed %LEL value *10     
`dpID 11` error state: 0x00 = default / 0x02 = gas detected       
`dpID 16` mute sound: 0 = nothing / 1 = mutes currently playing sound     

Sensor uses the built in speaker as an alarm and to play an array of voice prompts following almost every action:

The speaker and onboard led are controlled by the MCU and there is no way to control them by software.

Temperature is not reported on any dpId (same behaviour as in original firmware) and is only displayed on the built-in LCD.

On the back is a 2pin JST connector with pins labelled `+` and `-` which is supposed to be used with an electric valve to trigger automatic shutoff when gas is detected.

## Configuration
Please read [TuyaMCU](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU) article to understand the terminology and configuration process.

Change device to a TuyaMCU module (or apply the provided template, result is the same)
```console
Module 54
```

Set the following configuration:
```json
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 12,16; TuyaMCU 51,51
```

## Functions
Gas sensor status will be mapped to POWER1. ON is "gas detected" and OFF is "no gas detected".

POWER2 can be turned on to stop currently playing sound/voice prompt.

Gas value is sent on dpId2. Use a rule to send it to a custom topic:

```console
Rule1 ON TuyaReceived#dptype2id2 DO Publish stat/%topic%/GAS %value% ENDON
```
Enable rule with `Rule1 1`

Label webUI buttons
```console
Backlog WebButton1 Gas; WebButton2 Mute
```
