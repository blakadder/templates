Replaced WB3S (BK7231T) with ESP-12F flashed with Tasmota.  No pull down resistor on GPIO15 needed, but with mine I needed a pull up resistor on CH_PD (EN) ( I may have ripped the pad during removal ).

After replacing WiFi module, one of the relays in the power strip will turn on and off repeatedly but will stop after configuring Tasmota

To enable multipress buttons to control the individual outlets (1 button press for outlet 1, 2 button presses for outlet 2, etc, hold button for 5 seconds for outlet 6), use the following commands in the console:

```console
SetOption1 1
SetOption73 1
Rule1 ON button1#state=10 DO Power1 2 ENDON ON button1#state=11 DO Power2 2 ENDON ON button1#state=12 DO Power3 2 ENDON ON button1#state=13 DO Power4 2 ENDON ON button1#state=14 DO Power5 2 ENDON ON button1#state=3 DO Power6 2 ENDON
Rule1 1
```
