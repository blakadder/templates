This is relatively easy replacement. No hot gun, etc, just soldering iron and solder wick. Chip has to be programmed prior to soldering. I used [ESP8685-WROOM-05](ESP8685-WROOM-05) which fits into the same slot with no further modifications required.

Tasmota options required for this template:

```console
PowerOnState 1
Setoption37 25
Setoption92 1
