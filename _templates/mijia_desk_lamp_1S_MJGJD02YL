## Hardware

There are three GPIOs in use:

- `GPIO04`: global light enable/disable. As long as this output is high, the WW/CW channels will light.
- `GPIO19`: Cold White channel
- `GPIO21`: Warm White channel

### Templates

This template keeps `GPIO4` high and relies on Tasmota setting both `GPIO19` and `GPIO21` to fully off to shut the light off.

Most people should use this template.

```json
{"NAME":"Mijia Desk Lamp 1S (MJGJD02YL)","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,3840,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,416,0,417,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1,"CMND":"DimmerRange 45,255"}
```

If you want to control the global on/off (`GPIO04`) independently of the WW/CW channels, use this template:

```json
{"NAME":"Mijia Desk Lamp 1S (MJGJD02YL)","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,224,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,416,0,417,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1,"CMND":"DimmerRange 45,255"}
```

### Dimmer Range

In testing, neither the WW and CW channel would light until a dimmer value of ~30 was used.
There was noticeable flicker until a dimmer value of ~35 was used.

When attempting to use a combination of WW and CW light, the light would be off until a dimmer of ~40 was used. Like the independent channels at a dimmer value of ~30, there was some noticeable flicker.

For this reason, a `DimmerRange` of 45-255 is suggested.
Tasmota will let you dim the light as low as possible without flicker.

Your lamp, eyes and needs will differ so feel free to see if a lower `dimmer` value will work for you by unlocking the full dimmer range with `DimmerRange 0,255` and then playing with the `ct` and `dimmer` commands to find the lowest tolerable brightness for your needs.

`DimmerRange 40,255` or `DimmerRange 45,255` suggested
