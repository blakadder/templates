Decouple Buttons from Relays
```
SetOption73 1
```

Single rule to handle fan speed logic
```console
Rule1

```

Enable rule with `Rule1 1`

Description:
`SetOption73` Decouples the buttons and relay
The VAR1 can be thought of as "NextSpeed" and VAR2 as "Next Power", if it makes it easier to read the code

Notes:
- Relay 1 is the main light relay controlled by button1 (the light button)
- Relay 2 is the main fan relay controlled by the button2 (the fan button)
- Relay 3 is the secondary fan relay controlled by the bottom3 (the array buttons)
- Relay 4 is the tertiary fan relay not physically connected to any buttons

Rule Logic
- Relay 3 and 4 will always turn on with Relay 2
- VAR1 is set to 3 at Initialisation and when the fan is powered off to ensure full power to fan to startup
- VAR2 is set to 1 at Initialisation to control the fan "next power state"
- Button 2 will always toggle the power to the fan (and reset state)
- Button 3 will always decrease speed one at a time 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3

*** HOME ASSISTANT - 2021.7 new fan layout needs different config. Old config has been deprecated and no longer works.
1. Do above steps (SetOption73, Rule1)
2. Add Rule: (edit the MQTT publish to suit your setup)
```console
Rule2 ON var1#State DO Publish stat/master-bedroom/%topic%/fanspeed %value% ENDON
```
3. Activate Rule
```console
Rule2 1
```
4. Home Assistant configuration.yaml
Notes on fields to change:
 - name (change to your device name)
 - unique_id (anything unique)
 - mqtt topics: replace 'master-bedroom/bedroomfanlightswitch' with whatever your setup uses
