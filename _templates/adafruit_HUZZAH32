Module: `ESP32-WROOM-32`

## Manual Flashing

This board has an integrated SiLabs `CP2104` USB to UART converter built in so flashing doesn't require an external interface board.

In addition to a `tasmota32.bin` binary file there are three additional binaries (`boot_app0.bin`, `bootloader_dout_40m.bin`, `partitions.bin`) required for flashing an ESP32, which can be found here:

<https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota-firmware/tree/main/release-firmware/tasmota32/ESP32_needed_files>

The latest ESP32 binary builds can be found here:

<http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota32/release/>

With these files downloaded, this `esptool.py` command worked to flash the device with Tasmota:

```sh
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dout --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect 0x1000 bootloader_dout_40m.bin 0x8000 partitions.bin 0xe000 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 tasmota32.bin
```

See <https://tasmota.github.io/docs/ESP32/> for the latest information.

## Tasmotizer

[Tasmotizer](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer) does not currently support ESP32 chips so it can't be used to flash the device.

However, once a device is flashed with Tasmota, the Tasmotizer GUI can be used to configure the board with serial commands to set up WiFi and template configuration.

## Template Notes

The provided template sets up the I2C pins (`GPIO22`/`SCL`, `GPIO23`/`SDA`) as well as 7 ADCs for the pins labeled A0-A5 on the board and the `VBAT` sensor. `GPIO13` is set as an LED for the board's red indicator LED but can also be used as a GPIO or ADC input if needed.

## Device Notes

The board has a resistive divider connected to `VBAT` that goes into pin `GPIO35`/`ADC1_7`. `VBAT` is available on a 2-pin JST header as well as the `BAT` pin next to it and is intended to be used with a 4.2V/3.7V LiPo or LiIon battery.

This isn't useful for Tasmota but for power saving purposes the built-in 3.3V regulator can be disabled by pulling the `EN` pin to ground. This will power down the ESP32 module and everything else on the board aside from the USB to UART converter.
