## Template Notes

The provided template sets up the I2C pins (`GPIO22`/`SCL`, `GPIO23`/`SDA`) as well as 7 ADCs for the pins labeled A0-A5 on the board and the `VBAT` sensor. `GPIO13` is set as an LED for the board's red indicator LED but can also be used as a GPIO or ADC input if needed.

## Device Notes

The board has a resistive divider connected to `VBAT` that goes into pin `GPIO35`/`ADC1_7`. `VBAT` is available on a 2-pin JST header as well as the `BAT` pin next to it and is intended to be used with a 4.2V/3.7V LiPo or LiIon battery.

This isn't useful for Tasmota but for power saving purposes the built-in 3.3V regulator can be disabled by pulling the `EN` pin to ground. This will power down the ESP32 module and everything else on the board aside from the USB to UART converter.
