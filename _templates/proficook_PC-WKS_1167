### Flashing
Tuya-Convert is the more convenient option for installing Tasmota but it is possible to flash over serial. 

When flashing using Tuya-Convert press and hold 45°C button for 5 seconds to enter fast flashing mode and follow the normal tuya-convert procedure.

When flashing via serial connection remember to pull the MCU Reset Pin to ground. It's a HR7P169BFGSF from Easysoft so pin 4 must be connected to ground. 

### Functions
MCU Product ID: {"p":"h6MjwrnldNTu4kX3","v":"1.0.0","m":1} 

`dpID 101` controls kettle modes (corresponds to device buttons)
  - `0` - heat to 45°C then maintain temperature for 2 hours
  - `1` - heat to 60°C then maintain temperature for 2 hours
  - `2` - heat to 85°C then maintain temperature for 2 hours
  - `3` - heat to 100°C then maintain temperature for 3 minutes
  - `4` - heat to 100°C (power button flashing when active)
  - `5` - heat to preset temperature (70°C by default, can be changed using `dpID 102`) then maintain temperature for 2 hours (keep warm button)
  - `6` - reset any running program and enter standby mode (pulsating power button)
          
`dpID 102` sets water temperature for mode `5` (keep warm button), recommended 35 - 100 range

`dpID 104` error notification: 
  - `0x00` - no error 
  - `0x01` - kettle empty 
  - `0x04` - kettle overheated due to too much or too little water

`dpID 105` reports current water temperature    

`dpID 106` reports kettle status:
  - `1` - kettle removed from base
  - `2` - standby mode
  - `3` - heating to programmed target temperature
  - `4` - cooling down to programmed target temperature
  - `5` - maintaining programmed target temperature

`dpID 107` reports approximate time until programmed target temperature is reached or remaining time for maintaining programmed target temperature when in mode `5`. Cannot be changed!

`dpID 108` is still unknown, it is always reporting `5` and doesn't respond to any of the TuyaSend commands.

### Configuration

After applying the template and configuring Wi-Fi and MQTT the preconfigured relay will not control anything. 

For controlling the kettle modes you'll have to use the `TuyaSend` command:
- `TuyaSend4 101,0` - 45°C
- `TuyaSend4 101,1` - 60°C 
- `TuyaSend4 101,2` - 85°C 
- `TuyaSend4 101,3` - 100°C
- `TuyaSend4 101,4` - 100°C without maintaining temp
- `TuyaSend4 101,5` - keep warm
- `TuyaSend4 101,6` - standby mode and reset if running a program
*It is required to use `101,6` if you want to switch from one temperature to another.*

Set target temperature with:

`TuyaSend2 102,<value>`

***or***

`TuyaMCU 21,102` to use dimmer to set temperature. With this you can use the slider or `Dimmer` command and it will prevent you from accidentally setting temperatures higher than 100°C. *Might potentially create issues if you don't have another relay configured.*

If you don't have an external solution for easy control you can map a dummy relay for controlling kettle modes and link them with TuyaSend using rules. *States will not be in sync if controlled with other means. Set `PowerOnState 0` to avoid weirdness on device reset.*
Example:
Use preconfigured Relay1 to activate 45°C mode.
```console
Rule ON Power1#State=1 DO TuyaSend4 101,0 ENDON ON Power1#State=0 DO TuyaSend4 101,6 ENDON
```

Send water temperature to an MQTT topic:
```console
Rule ON TuyaReceived#DpType2Id105 DO Publish stat/%topic%/TEMPERATURE %value% ENDON
```

Override device button action and `TuyaSend4 101,x` command. *Has a minor side effect of multiple beeps.*
 Example overrides 45°C (`mode 0`) and instead controls another Tasmota light. 
```console
Rule ON TuyaReceived#DpType4Id101=0 DO Backlog TuyaSend4 101,6; Publish cmnd/coffee_light/POWER toggle ENDON 
```

Put kettle in standby mode when keep warm timer reaches 110 minutes aka keep warm function lasts only 10 minutes now. 
```console
Rule ON TuyaReceived#DpType2Id107=110 DO TuyaSend4 101,6 ENDON
```
I'm using this rule because I mostly heat water to custom temps with mode 5 and I don't need the kettle to keep heating the water for the next 2 hours.

`TuyaMCU 11,108` sets the relay to `dpID 108` which avoids superfluous MCU messages that are sent when issuing a command to a nonexistent dpID.

### Home Assistant Configuration
This implementation is suited to my specific needs and should serve as a blueprint, not a definite solution.

First set `SetOption66 1` to enable sending all TuyaReceived data over MQTT!
