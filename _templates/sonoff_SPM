Using latest development branch, compile tasmota32 firmware with:

```c
#define USE_SONOFF_SPM 
#define USE_ETHERNET
```
and apply the template.

## Features

 * Bulk of the action is handled by ARM processors present in every unit communicating over modbus RS-485.
 * Each SPM-4Relay has 4 bistable relays with their own CSE7761 energy monitoring device handled by an ARM processor.
 * Green led is controlled by ARM processor indicating SD-Card access.
 * ESP32 is used as interface between eWelink and ARM processor in SPM-Main unit communicating over proprietary serial protocol.
 * Power on sequence for two SPM-4Relay modules is 00-00-15-10-(0F)-(13)-(13)-(19)-0C-09-04-09-04-0B-0B
 * Up to six months of daily energy are stored onthe SD-Card. Previous data is lost.
 * Tasmota support is based on Sonoff SPM v1.0.0 ARM firmware.
  
Implemented in Tasmota:
 * Up to 7 SPM-4Relay units supporting up to 28 relays.
 * Gui optimized rotating energy display for 4 relays at a time.
 * Button on SPM-Main initiates re-scan of SPM-4Relay units.
 * Blue led equals Tasmota WiFi status.
 * Yellow led lights if no ARM connection can be made.
 * Yellow led blinks 2 seconds if an ARM-ESP comms CRC error is detected.
 * Ethernet support
 * webUI display
 * Persistence for module mapping
 
To-do:
 * Gui for Overload Protection entry (is handled by ARM processor).
 * Gui for Scheduling entry (is handled by ARM processor).
 * SPI master to ARM (ARM firmware upload from ESP using EasyFlash).
