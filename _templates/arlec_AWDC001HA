## MCU Functions

- `dpid1` Power relay - When toggled will turn fan on / off.
- `dpid2` Sets the target boil temperature: `0` = Natural, `1` = Sleep Mode, `2` = Manual Mode
  - Natural Mode: The fan speed varies randomly between (speed 3 to 6), in - the interval of every 15 seconds, 	giving the effect of a natural breeze.
  - Sleep Mode: The fan will operate at speed setting 1
  - Manual Mode: Fan speed is set by dpid3
- `dpid3` Sets the fan speed `0` slow - `6` fast, (remote display 1 - 6)
- `dpid6` Sets the timer function `0` = 9 hours, `1` = 8 hours, `2` = 7 hours ..... `9` = Off
- `dpid101` Swing Mode. `1` = Fan will oscillate horizontally, (from left to right), `0` = Off

Configure Tasmota's DpIds with the correct FnIds:
```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 61,2; TuyaMCU 64,3; TuyaMCU 99,6; TuyaMCU 12,101;
```
Used the following rule to detect speed

```console
Backlog Rule1 on tuyareceived#dptype4id3 do publish stat/%topic%/speed %value% endon; Rule1 1
```
