**Supported since Tasmota 9.2+**

After flashing Tasmota, apply the template and then use the *Firmware upgrade - File upload* menu to flash the **required** STM32 firmware (provided at [shelly-dimmer-stm32 releases page](https://github.com/jamesturton/shelly-dimmer-stm32/releases)) to the MCU. 
The template must be set before flashing the STM32 firmware.

After the firmware upgrade for the STM32 firmware you should execute some commands: 
1. switchmode 11 -> pushbutton with dimmer mode
2. use "SetOption32" to set the time for dim up/down start (10 = 1 sec)
3. If you want to use the dimmer with one button mode, you can check here:
[https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Rules/#control-a-dimmer-with-one-switch](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Rules/#control-a-dimmer-with-one-switch)
(be sure to change the MQTT topics to the right ones your device is using)
4. Ledtable 0 -> Disable gamma control
5. ShdLeadingEdge -> set to 0 for trailing edge and 1 to leading edge. Be careful to set the right type for your load!
6. Exceute "Dimmer 1" and then use the "DimmerRange" command beginning counting from 0 upwards (DimmerRange 0, DimmerRange 1 and so on), until you see your light start dimming.
7. If you have flickering at low light levels, try the new ShdWarmupBrightness command (see [https://github.com/jamesturton/shelly-dimmer-stm32/pull/23](https://github.com/jamesturton/shelly-dimmer-stm32/pull/23) ). Use only with LED and at your own risk!

You can try to revert back to the stock firmware using OTA with this tool if you have any issues: 
[https://github.com/yaourdt/tasmota-to-mgos](https://github.com/yaourdt/tasmota-to-mgos)
If this fails you have to use the serial connection. If you reverted back to the original Shelly firmware the STM32 should be flashed back automatically to the originally Shelly version.
