This is a Tuya dehumidifier. There is also a larger unit in the same range, the CD20PRO-LE, so these instructions will likely work for that too.

`MCU Product ID: tns1hza48otl6oiz1.0.0`

## OTA Flashing
I tried flashing with Tuya Convert (2.4.4) but it did not work, so I needed to flash via serial, and hence locate and extract the TYWE3S chip.

## Extracting the TYWE3S chip

* **Disconnect mains power**.
* Remove the water tank (if the unit has been running) so nothing spills out when the electronics are exposed.
* Looking at the rear of the unit, there are four recessed screws down each side that you need to remove.
* With the screws removed, the _front_ panel (i.e. with the light and the logo) should come away in one piece.
* The front panel will still be attached to the main unit via a cable connecting the light, but there's a JST-SM-style inline connector you can unplug to free the front panel completely.
* With the front panel out of the way, and looking into the exposed front of the unit, locate the sealed plastic box at the bottom right, next to the compressor, with lots of cables running into it. This contains the electronics, including the TYWE3S chip we need to flash. But it also contains mains voltage terminals and capacitors, so be careful.
* There are three screws you'll need to remove fastening the box to the main unit.
* With the screws removed, you should have enough cable slack to slide the box out of the front of the unit.
* The box itself is held closed by a single screw near the centre of the lid, which you need to remove, and four clips that need opening around the outside of lid.
* Inside the box, the TYWE3S is secured by single screw, and connected to the main board via ribbon cable attached to a header.
* Remove the screw from the TYWE3S and remove the cable from the header on the TYWE3S side. The chip should now be free and ready to flash.

## Serial Flashing

Since the chip has a header, it's trivial to connect the GND, TX and RX pins to your USB-to-serial adapter via Dupont cables. However, the header power pin is labelled 5V (not the 3V3 required by the chip) and there's no GPIO0 on the header. So you'll need to connect the 3V3 and GPIO0 direct to the chip (e.g. with pincer probes). See [TYWE3S](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/TYWE3S) pinout. With everything connected you can now flash the chip - and then reassemble the unit.

## Device Configuration

Please read [TuyaMCU](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU) article to understand the terminology and configuration process. Then apply this template.

## Functions
- `dpID 1`, `Boolean` controls device power - turns the device on/off      
- `dpID 2`, `Enum` sets mode.
  - `0` Dehumidify and Purify
  - `1` Purify Only.
- `dpID 3`, `Integer` current humidity.
- `dpID 4`, `Integer` target humidity.
- `dpID 5`, `Boolean` has no effect.
- `dpID 10`, `Boolean` has no effect.
- `dpID 101`, `Boolean` turns humidity indicator light on/off (shows green/orange/red based on current humidity).
- `dpID 102`, `Enum` has no effect.
- `dpID 103`, `Integer` current temperature.
- `dpID 104`, `Boolean` has no effect.

### Configuration

Next we need to map the above to their respective Tasmota functions.

```console
backlog TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 61,2; TuyaMCU 73,3; TuyaMCU 21,4; TuyaMCU 12,101; 
TuyaMCU 71,103; TuyaMCU 99,5; TuyaMCU 99,10; TuyaMCU 99,102; TuyaMCU 99,104; SetOption20 1; SetOption54 1;
```

Note: `Dimmer` maps to dpID4 for target humidity select (its better to use console commands to be more precise). `SetOption20 1` and `SetOption54 1` stop the dimmer from controlling the power.

Label webUI buttons:
```console
backlog webbutton1 Power; webbutton2 Indicator Light;
```
### TuyaEnum 
As of Tasmota 9.1.0.1 [#9769](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/pull/9769) it is possible to map Type4 dpIDs (such as dpID2) to an Enum fn ID. 

Map dpID2 to Enum1:
```console
TuyaMCU 61,2
```
Set Enum1 range (in this case, to allow values `0` and `1` only). 
```console
TuyaEnumList 1,1
```

Now you can control the mode with `TuyaEnum1 <x>` where `x` is `0` or `1`. If you try a number outside the Enum1 range it will throw an error.
