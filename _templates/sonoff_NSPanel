[Review](https://blakadder.com/sonoff-nspanel/), [full teardown](https://blakadder.com/nspanel-teardown/) and [protocol decoding](https://blakadder.com/nspanel-hacking).

## Serial Flashing

Unclip the panel from the base. Remove two bottom screws and lift the plastic cover. 

The five needed pins (3V3, RX, TX, GPIO0 and GND) can be easily identified. 

![Pins](/assets/images/sonoff_NSpanel_pinout.jpg)

Download a custom built [`tasmota32-nspanel.bin`](https://github.com/blakadder/nspanel/raw/main/tasmota32-nspanel.bin) using [recommended](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/ESP32/#flashing) ESP32 flashing methods.

If using standard Tasmota32 builds: Current implementation of serial in Arduino core has a bug which will will boot loop the device on soft reset. Power cycling the device solves the issue. PSRAM is also not supported.

## Configuration

After the flash is complete disconnect the 3.3V power and either power the touch plate using its base or connect to 5V power using the headers.

Apply the template and make sure "Module 0" is selected. The template will apply some of the commands required.

Download the NSPanel driver file [`nspanel.be`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blakadder/nspanel/main/nspanel.be). Navigate to **Consoles - Manage File system** in the web UI. Upload the driver to NSPanel with "Choose file" followed by "Start Upload".

![Upload driver](/assets/images/sonoff_NSpanel_driver.jpg)

To load the driver on startup you can either:
- change the filename to `autoexec.be`
- **Create and edit new file** named `autoexec.be` with a line `load("nspanel")`

## Screen Commands

To control and communicate with the screen, driver introduces new commands and parsing of the NSPanel protocol. NSPanel protocol is [documented here](https://blakadder.github.io/nspanel/) (all updates are welcome).

### NSPSend 

To control the switch GUI the `NSPSend` command is introduced

`NSPSend <json_payload>` sends a command to the screen using [NSPanel protocol](https://blakadder.github.io/nspanel)

`NSPSend2 <nextion_command>` sends a command to the screen using [Nextion protocol](https://nextion.tech/instruction-set/). This requires the screen to be in "Nextion mode" with command `NSPMode 1`.

### NSPMode

`NSPMode` command switches the command mode of the screen. Command with no payload returns the current state. 

`0` is the default NSPanel protocol. Screen is always in `0` on startup. 

`1` puts the screen in Nextion command mode. When the screen is in this mode NSPanel commands will not work.

_The code might not be 100% reliable and state tracking might fail_

### NSPDim

`NSPDim` is used to turn on the "Energy-saving mode". Value is stored in `_persist.json`

`0` is the default where the screen stays on permanently but dimmed. 

`1` turns on the Energy-saving mode in which screen turns off after the set timeout period.

### NSPLocation

`NSPLocation <name>` to set location used for weather forecasts. Value is stored in `_persist.json`.

Location can be a name or latitude and longitude with 2 decimals max. Example: `North Pole` or `64.75,-147.34`

If you don't set it it'll show North Pole forecast. 

## Features 

Both relays and buttons, buzzer and temperature sensor are a part of Tasmota just like any standard switch. 

Use [`Buzzer`](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Buzzer/) command to control the buzzer.

To set which widgets to draw and thermostat settings you need to edit the `nspanel.be` file variables "widget" and "atc". 

Relay states are reflected on the main screen bottom bars using `set_power()` in the driver.

Time and date will update automatically each minute according to Tasmota time using `set_clock()`.

Weather updates will use NSPLocation value using function `set_weather()` to fetch data from [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/:help). Since it currently cannot provide date range I winged it by using Feelslike temperature.

Indoor temperature will update on TelePeriod using the NSPanel temperature probe data with `set_temp()` functions. You can change the source by commenting out associated `tasmota.add_rule` triggers or update remotely with `NSPSend {"temperature":24.5,"tempUnit":"C"}`.

Every touch event will be reported in Tasmota logs and can be used in rules with trigger `NSPanel#...`

If you want the option to reset the screen change GPIO4 to "Relay 3". This pin need to be low for the screen to turn on so set `PulseTime3 2` to temporarily pull it high just enough for the screen to reset.


## Use Example
When turning on thermostat toggle object Tasmota receives `tele/nspanel/RESULT = {"NSPanel":{"ATCEnable":1}}` command in logs. This can be used in a rule:

```console
Rule1 on NSPanel#ATCEnable do Publish cmnd/heater/Power1 %value% endon
```
When triggered, the rule will send a Power command to the heater switch with Tasmota with the value of the toggle object.

To mirror the state of the heater with the screen you can create a rule on the heater switch to send updates to the screen with:
```console
rule1 on power1#state do cmnd/nspanel/nspsend {"ATCEnable":%value%} endon`
```
