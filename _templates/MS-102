Generic garage door controller, TuyaMCU relay with magnetic reed switch

## Configuration

Config might need to be adjusted to have LED work correctly.


```console
Backlog TuyaMCU 2,101; TuyaMCU 11,1; TuyaMCU 0,7; Switchmode1 4; Switchmode2 1
```
```console
Rule1 on switch2#state=1 do publish2 stat/%topic%/POWER2 Open endon on switch2#state=0 do publish2 stat/%topic%/POWER2 Closed endon
```
Enable rule with `Rule1 1`

https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Rules/#garage-door-opener has more on used rules.

## Features
- fnId=2 is set for dpId=101
- fnId=11 is set for dpId=1 
- fnId=0 is set for dpId=7

## Update Sept 2022

## Features used
- fnId=12 is set for dpId=101   <  CHANGED to "fnId":12,"dpId":101  relay2 normal mode.
- fnId=11 is set for dpId=1    <<< This auto configures and can't be changed. 
- fnId=0 is set for dpId=7     <<< Timer? Left it at zero

Switchmode2 15 is advised, This wasn't previously available. 
SaveState 0 `setoption0 0` was needed to stop the door auto opening on restarts

The power2 topic can be changed to sensor or anything. stat/%topic%/SENSOR etc.
It can be setup as a [door binary sensor](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Home-Assistant/#binary-sensors)
similiar to [Motion sensor](https://blakadder.com/pir-in-tasmota-integration/) 
`off_delay: 30` needs to be omitted!
Add `payload_on` and `payload_off` if you want to change from `ON OFF` to `Open Closed` etc.
You could also set the rules to use TuyaRecv instead of switch2#state eg. TuyaReceived#Data=55AA03070005650100010075 {"TuyaReceived":{"Data":"55AA03070005650100010075","Cmnd":7,"CmndData":"6501000100","DpType1Id101":0,"101":{"DpId":101,"DpIdType":1,"DpIdData":"00"}}}

## Auto discovery in Tasmota Integration.

The juicy bit and reason for changing dp101 from switch2 to relay2.
Switch2 never provided a UI interface in Tasmota GUI, Relay2 does, (with switchmode 15) it doesn't trigger anything.
Relay2 also allows a second friendly names.
eg. `Friendly Name 1	Garage Door, Friendly Name 2	Garage Reed`

That change also completes the setup for autodiscovery. No rules actually needed.
You will have a real switch that activates the door and a non working switch that follows the Reed sensor(although you can still toggle it).
