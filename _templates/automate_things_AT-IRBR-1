With over 10 Meters range, the IR Bridge allows you to control almost any infrared device and is compatible with 
[Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Tasmota-IR/) and [ESPhome](https://esphome.io/components/remote_transmitter/). 
If you are feeling ambitious then you can even use the [IRremoteESP8266](https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266) 
Library with Arduino!

With the 38kHz IR Receiver you can configure Tasmota to relay IR signals via WiFi and repeat IR signals in a different room using a 2nd IR 
Bridge.

The device can be easily integrated into home automation solutions such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). 
You can even place the device behind your TV and it should still be able to control it.

The best part is that as *you* decide what Firmware to install on it there is no need for another Mobile App or a Cloud Subscription.

**What you get:**
- 1x Wemos D1 Mini (Optional)
- 1x IR Bridge PCB
- 9x TSAL6400 IR LEDs
- 3x 2N2222A
- 3x 6R8 Resistors
- 1x TSOP38238 38kHz IR Receiver

**Things you will need to provide:**
  - 5V/1A Power Supply via Micro USB.
