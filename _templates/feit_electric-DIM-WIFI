**Caution!** There has been [a report](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/costco-feit-smart-dimmer-tuya-convert-tasmota/151390/7) of Tasmota not communicating with the MCU properly.  This seems to have been cleared up.

There are two options:

* Unsolder the chip and flash it, then solder back, or
* Flash it directly on the board (easiest and fastest choice)

Solder your serial pin to:

remove the cover metalk shield over the ESP8265 to access to gpio0
ground the PIN 15 at the power up (GPIO0)

**Note:** On at least some versions, the Tuya MCU is
  connected to the RX/TX pins, which prevents flashing via the serial
  port. This can be remedied by cutting the trace between the serial
  pin and the MCU (suggested location in picture). Remember to
  reconnect it after flashing!

Flash it with you tasmota flavor.

After activating the template, enter these commands into the Tasmota console.

Set the dimmer mapping.
```console
TuyaMCU 21,2
```

Set min/max dim
```console
DimmerRange 10,1000
```

Configure sending of state and power MQTT messages: (Optional)
```console
SetOption59 1
```
