The Gosund WB4 template worked perfectly. (Took a guess, since the ESP8266EX PCB contains two things, first a pcb name CUCO_Z1_V1.2(ESP8266) And, below a sticker with a qr code for the serial number, and a printed product number+serial number, and the text "Model: WB4" on it.) The PCBs aren't really accessible, the main cable prevents you from fully taking them out. The box and product itself don't contain branding, and the box has a different product name on it. The top of the box has "Wireless Smart LED Bulb", the bottom has DSB01A as the model.
