New from Factory (Feb '19) has patched firmware blocking Tuya-Convert
New from Factory (Jan '22) board version KS811_B_V02 does not have an ESP8266 chipset but rather a Beken BK7231N chipset, which is totally incompatible with Tasmota.

Flash Instructions: Unscrew 4 screws on rear, use serial to flash. Ground IO0 while booting to get into flash mode.
