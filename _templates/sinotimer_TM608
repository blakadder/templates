No success with Tuya-convert. Opens relatively easy. Has a TYWE3S module inside. The TX/RX is unconnected so can easily be flashed via serial connection.
Edit 06/09/2021 : bought 6 of those TM608 and got some models with WB3S inside, the swap with a ESP12S Was done successfully.
Note its quite tricky to desolder the module withs a soldering iron. with a hot air station its a lot more easy.
